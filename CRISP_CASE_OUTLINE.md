# THE DEFENSE OF PETER GOLUB: A CRISP NARRATIVE
## "The Impossible Breath"

### 1. THE HOOK: 144 Seconds (The Biological Impossibility)
*Ladies and gentlemen, how long can you hold your breath? 30 seconds? A minute?*
*Now, how long can you BLOW air out continuously?*

**The Fact:**
On September 6, 2023, the State's machine recorded Peter Golub blowing air continuously for **144 seconds**.

**The Science:**
-   **Human Lung Capacity:** ~5 liters.
-   **Machine Minimum Flow:** 0.15 liters/second.
-   **Math:** 144 seconds x 0.15 L/s = **21.6 Liters**.
-   **Conclusion:** The machine required Peter Golub to have lungs **four times larger than an average human**.

**The Argument:**
This isn't just an error. It is a biological impossibility. If a thermometer told you a chicken was cooked at 4,000 degrees, you wouldn't eat the chicken—you'd throw away the thermometer.
**The State asks you to convict based on a machine that records miracles.**

### 2. THE CONTEXT: The 24x Hunter (Confirmation Bias)
*Why did the officer accept a 144-second test? Why didn't he stop, reset, or check the machine?*

**The Fact:**
Corporal Brock Ernstsen arrests drivers for DUI at a rate **24 times the state average**.

**The Argument:**
This is **Confirmation Bias**.
-   He wasn't investigating; he was hunting.
-   When you arrest everyone you stop, you stop looking for the truth.
-   He saw what he wanted to see, even when the machine showed him something impossible.
-   He ignored the **0/4 clues** on the One-Leg Stand (Peter passed perfectly).
-   He ignored the **perfect driving** for 10 blocks.

### 3. THE GHOST: "Officer 2" (The Broken Process)
*The State claims this was a standard arrest. So where is the other officer?*

**The Fact:**
-   Video shows a second officer present for **3.5 hours**.
-   He assisted with the arrest, the search, the tow.
-   **He is not in the police report.**
-   **He is not on the witness list.**
-   **The State won't tell us his name.**

**The Argument:**
This is a **Brady Violation** (hiding evidence).
Why hide a witness? Because he saw something that didn't fit the narrative?
The State deleted a human being from the official record just like they want you to delete the 144-second error from your mind.

### 4. THE PROCEDURAL FAILURE: Rights Delayed
*The rules apply to everyone. Especially the police.*

**The Fact:**
-   **Minute 5:** Peter ordered out of car (Custody).
-   **Minute 85:** Peter read his rights (Miranda).
-   **The Gap:** 80 minutes of custody without rights.

**The Argument:**
Deontology (Duty). The State has a duty to follow the rules. If they break the rules to catch a citizen, they have broken the law themselves.
-   Illegal Stop (Obstructed view).
-   Impossible Test (144s).
-   Hidden Witness (Officer 2).
-   Delayed Rights (80 mins).

### 5. THE CLOSING
"The State wants you to ignore the physics of the human body. They want you to ignore the missing officer. They want you to ignore the 24x bias.
They want you to trust a machine that says a man exhaled for two and a half minutes without stopping.
**Reasonable doubt isn't just possible here; it is mathematically guaranteed.**"
