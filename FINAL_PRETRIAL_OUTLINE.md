# FINAL PRETRIAL PLAN FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 2026
## State v. Golub, Case No. 235900706 | Judge Hruby-Mills | Courtroom W47

---

## OPENING STATEMENT (30 seconds)

"Good afternoon, Your Honor. Before trial on January 22nd, I need to address eight issues: trial logistics, technology approval, witness and exhibit confirmation, outstanding discovery, the enhancement charge, voir dire time, and two jury instruction disputes. I'll be as efficient as possible."

---

## STRATEGIC ORDER OF ISSUES
*(Start with easy wins to build rapport, save contentious issues for last)*

---

### ISSUE 1: TRIAL LOGISTICS (Administrative - 2 minutes)

**Confirm on the record:**
- Trial dates: January 22-23, 2026
- Voir dire: 8:30 AM, Day 1
- Trial: 9:00 AM, Day 2
- Courtroom: W47 (or confirm)
- Expected length: 2 days
- Defendant will be present and representing pro se

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'd like to confirm on the record: trial is set for January 22-23, voir dire at 8:30 AM on Day 1, trial at 9:00 AM on Day 2, in this courtroom. Is that correct?"

---

### ISSUE 2: TECHNOLOGY/POWERPOINT APPROVAL (Easy win - 2 minutes)

**Request:** Permission to use laptop and projector for PowerPoint presentation

**Purpose:**
- Display video clips with timestamps (144-second breath test, FSTs)
- Show timeline graphics (Miranda, arrest sequence)
- Present side-by-side comparisons (officer testimony vs. video)
- Scientific diagrams (lung capacity, breath test protocols)

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting permission to use a laptop and the court's projector to display video clips, timelines, and demonstrative exhibits during trial. This will help the jury follow complex technical evidence. I can provide my equipment or use the court's. May I have approval?"

**If approved:** "Thank you. What's the setup procedure? Should I arrive early to test equipment?"

---

### ISSUE 3: WITNESS & EXHIBIT CONFIRMATION (3 minutes)

**State's Witness List:** Currently shows only Cpl. Brock Ernstsen  
**State's Exhibit List:** Review for any surprise exhibits

**Questions for the State:**
1. Is the State calling any witnesses besides Cpl. Ernstsen?
2. Is the State calling any expert witnesses?
3. Will the State call "Officer 2" (second officer visible in video)?
4. Any changes to the exhibit list?

**Defense Position:**
- Defense exhibit list filed January 9, 2026 (includes Officer 2 omission as Brady violation)
- Defense may call defendant (decision reserved)
- No defense witnesses beyond defendant

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'd like to confirm witness lists. The State's list shows only Corporal Ernstsen. Is that correct, Mr. Johnson? Specifically, will the State be calling the second officer who appears in the video evidence for over three hours?"

---

### ISSUE 4: OUTSTANDING DISCOVERY (5 minutes)

**Outstanding Items - Brady/Giglio Demand:**

| Item | Status | Importance |
|------|--------|------------|
| COBRA Data (Computerized Online Breath Archives) | NOT RECEIVED | Shows flow rate during 144-second test - critical to proving machine malfunction |
| Officer 2 Identity | NOT DISCLOSED | Brady material - officer present 3.5+ hours, omitted from all reports; transcript shows active involvement in arrest, search, inventory, and tow |
| Officer 2 Bodycam | NOT PRODUCED | Potentially exculpatory/impeachment material; transcript reveals Officer 2 conducted vehicle inventory and interacted with tow truck driver |
| Complete Intoxilyzer Maintenance Logs | PARTIAL | Beyond certification dates - need error logs |
| Ernstsen Personnel File | GRAMMA REQUEST DENIED | Complaints, discipline, prior testimony issues - second GRAMMA request for complaints, previous cases, testimony denied |

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I have outstanding discovery demands under Brady and Giglio. First, the COBRA data - the Intoxilyzer 8000 stores digital logs of flow rate and time for every test. This data would definitively show whether the machine malfunctioned during the 144-second test. I need this before trial.

Second, Officer 2. The video shows a second officer present for over three and a half hours. He made the arrest, searched the vehicle, handled the tow. Yet he's not in any police report, not on the witness list, and we still don't know his name. The transcript from Officer 2's bodycam reveals he actively participated in the vehicle inventory, spoke with the tow truck driver, and was involved in the entire process. This is textbook Brady. His identity, his bodycam footage, and an explanation for why he was omitted from all documentation must be disclosed.

Third, regarding Corporal Ernstsen's personnel file, I filed a GRAMMA request seeking his complaints, disciplinary records, and prior testimony issues. This second request was denied. Under Brady, the State must disclose impeachment material in the officer's personnel file. I request the Court order the State to produce this material or conduct an in camera review.

I request the Court order production by January 17th, or an adverse inference instruction at trial."

---

### ISSUE 5: ENHANCEMENT CHARGE - BIFURCATION REQUEST (5 minutes)

**The Problem:**
- State seeks DUI 2nd Offense enhancement (Class A Misdemeanor)
- Prior conviction was City of Holladay v. Golub (2019) - **RECKLESS DRIVING**, not DUI
- Enhancement requires prior DUI conviction, not reckless driving
- If prior is mentioned to jury, it's improper propensity evidence under Rule 404(b)

**Request:**
1. Bifurcate the enhancement from guilt phase
2. Jury determines guilt on DUI first
3. If guilty, then (and only then) Court addresses enhancement
4. Prior conviction should NOT be mentioned during guilt phase

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting bifurcation of the enhancement allegation. The State seeks a second-offense enhancement based on a 2019 reckless driving conviction - notably, not a DUI. Under Rule 404(b), evidence of prior convictions is inadmissible to prove propensity. If the jury hears about the prior conviction during the guilt phase, it's prejudicial and improper.

I request the Court bifurcate: the jury decides guilt first without hearing about the prior. If there's a conviction, the Court can address the enhancement separately. This protects my right to a fair trial on the current charges."

**Legal Authority:**
- Utah R. Evid. 404(b) - prior acts inadmissible to prove propensity
- State v. Nelson, 2015 UT 62 - bifurcation appropriate to prevent prejudice

---

### ISSUE 6: VOIR DIRE TIME ALLOCATION (5 minutes)

**Request:** 45 minutes for defense voir dire

**Justification:**
This case involves unusual scientific and credibility issues requiring careful juror questioning:

1. **144-Second Breath Test Anomaly** - Jurors need to understand that a 144-second continuous blow is physiologically impossible (requires 21.6 liters of air; human lung capacity is 4.8 liters). Must identify jurors who can evaluate scientific evidence critically.
2. **Officer Credibility/Confirmation Bias** - Under State v. Perea, 2013 UT 68, confirmation bias is a recognized phenomenon affecting investigations. This officer's arrest rate is 24x the state average. Need to identify jurors who understand that high volume doesn't equal accuracy.
3. **Pro Se Defendant** - Jurors may have biases about self-represented parties. Need time to explore.
4. **Burden of Proof** - Complex scientific evidence requires ensuring jurors truly understand "beyond reasonable doubt."

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves an officer whose DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average and a breath test that recorded a physiologically impossible 144-second continuous blow. Under State v. Perea, the Utah Supreme Court recognized that confirmation bias is real and affects investigations.

The jury needs to understand these issues, and I need adequate time to identify jurors who can fairly evaluate scientific evidence and officer credibility. Forty-five minutes is reasonable given the complexity."

**If Judge Pushes Back:**
"Your Honor, I'll be as efficient as possible. At minimum, I need 30 minutes. If I can complete questioning sooner, I will."

### ISSUE 7: JURY INSTRUCTION - "AFFIRMATIVE FINDINGS" DISPUTE (HIGHEST PRIORITY - 10 minutes)

**State's Problematic Instruction (Page 29):**
> "The Court has made the following affirmative findings concerning the Intoxilyzer machine... the affidavit establishes a rebuttable presumption that the Intoxilyzer machine was functioning properly."

**Why This Is Reversible Error:**

1. **Judicial Comment on Contested Evidence**
   - State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292 (Utah 1978) - prohibits court from commenting on contested facts
   - Officer ADMITTED the test was "improperly done" (Dec 31, 2024 hearing transcript)
   - Whether machine functioned properly is THE central disputed fact

2. **The 144-Second Test Is Scientifically Impossible**
   - Utah Admin. Code R714-500-6-A(3) requires breath specimen be "essentially alveolar or end expiratory in composition"
   - Human vital capacity: ~4.8 liters
   - 144 seconds at minimum flow rate (0.15 L/s) = 21.6 liters required
   - This is 450% of human lung capacity - a physiological impossibility
   - The "affirmative findings" cannot apply to a test that violates biological reality

3. **Invades Jury's Province**
   - Reliability of breath test is for jury to decide, not Court
   - Instruction tells jury what to believe about contested evidence

**Case Law Supporting Suppression of Anomalous Intoxilyzer Results:**
- State v. Schmidt, 2015-Ohio-5462 - Intoxilyzer 8000 results suppressed as scientifically unreliable
- State v. Ilg, 2014-Ohio-4258 - Ohio Supreme Court: defendants entitled to challenge reliability
- State v. Swindle, 23 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 613a (2015) - results suppressed for protocol violations
- State v. Mitchell, 31 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. 213a (2023) - results suppressed for inspection failures

**Requested Relief:**
1. Strike "affirmative findings" and "rebuttable presumption" language entirely
2. Replace with: "The jury shall determine from the evidence whether the breath testing device was properly operated and whether the results are reliable."
3. Alternatively, add Defense instruction that jury may consider evidence of testing anomalies

**Script:**
"Your Honor, the State's proposed instruction on page 29 tells the jury that this Court has made 'affirmative findings' about the Intoxilyzer and that there's a 'rebuttable presumption' it was functioning properly. This is reversible error under State v. Bradley.

Here's why: The officer himself testified on December 31st that the test was 'improperly done.' The video shows a 144-second continuous blow. Your Honor, that's physiologically impossible. Human lung capacity is about 4.8 liters. A 144-second blow at minimum flow rate would require 21.6 liters - four and a half times what any human can produce.

Utah Admin Code R714-500-6-A-3 requires the sample be 'essentially alveolar.' A sample that violates the laws of biology cannot be 'essentially alveolar.' Courts in Ohio and Florida have suppressed Intoxilyzer results for far less serious protocol violations.

Whether this machine was functioning properly is THE contested issue in this case. The State's instruction invades the jury's province and tells them what to believe. I request the Court strike that language and use the defense's proposed alternative that properly leaves this question to the jury."

**If Judge Defers to Trial:**
"Your Honor, I understand. I'm making a record now that I've raised this objection. I'll renew it before instructions are read. If the State's instruction is given over my objection, this is preserved error under Bradley."

### ISSUE 8: DEFENSE JURY INSTRUCTIONS (5 minutes)

**Defense Instructions to Adopt:**

| Instruction | Topic | Legal Basis |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| #6 | Confirmation Bias | State v. Perea, 2013 UT 68 |
| #7 | FST Administration Standards | NHTSA Manual; R714-500-6 |
| #8 | Breath Test Protocol Compliance | R714-500-6-A(3) "alveolar" standard |
| #10 | Initial Stop - Reasonable Suspicion | Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 |
| #11 | Single Sample Insufficiency | R714-500-6(E) requires two samples |

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I've filed five proposed defense instructions addressing confirmation bias under State v. Perea, field sobriety test standards, breath test protocol requirements under Utah Admin Code, reasonable suspicion for the initial stop, and the requirement for two breath samples under R714-500-6-E.

The State's evidence relies heavily on officer observations and a single anomalous breath test. The jury needs proper instruction on how to evaluate this evidence. I request the Court adopt these instructions or indicate which ones present issues so I can address them before trial."

---

## PRESERVE THE RECORD - CRITICAL

**If the Court refuses to rule on jury instructions:**

"Your Honor, I understand the Court's position. For the record, I'm preserving my objections to the State's proposed 'affirmative findings' instruction as violating State v. Bradley's prohibition on judicial comment on contested facts. I'm also preserving my request for Defense Instructions 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. I'll file written objections by January 17th and renew these objections before instructions are read at trial."

**Written Objections to File by January 17, 2026:**
1. Objection to "Affirmative Findings" instruction
2. Objection to mention of prior conviction during guilt phase
3. Demand for COBRA data and Officer 2 identification
4. Request for adverse inference if discovery not produced

---

## BACKUP ARGUMENTS & CONTINGENCIES

### If Judge Won't Hear Jury Instruction Arguments:
1. State: "I understand the Court's preference to address this at trial."
2. Make record: "I'm preserving these objections for the record under State v. Bradley."
3. File written objections by January 17, 2026
4. Request sidebar during trial when instructions are read

### If Judge Limits Voir Dire to Less Than 30 Minutes:
1. Accept what's given; don't antagonize
2. Prioritize: (a) scientific evidence evaluation, (b) police credibility, (c) burden of proof
3. Make record: "I'm noting for the record that I requested 45 minutes and was given [X]."

### If State Won't Identify Officer 2:
1. Request adverse inference instruction at trial
2. "Ladies and gentlemen, the State has failed to produce a second officer who was present for over three hours. You may infer that his testimony would have been unfavorable to the State."
3. Request continuance if State attempts to call Officer 2 at trial

### If State Objects to Bifurcation:
1. Argue: "The prior is a reckless driving conviction, not DUI. Its only purpose is prejudice."
2. Cite Rule 404(b) and State v. Nelson
3. Request limiting instruction at minimum

### If COBRA Data Not Produced:
1. Request Court order compelling production
2. Alternative: adverse inference that data would show machine malfunction
3. Argue: "The State cannot benefit from failing to preserve evidence that would prove or disprove machine reliability."

## ADDITIONAL NOTES FROM DOCUMENT REVIEW

- **Officer 2 Transcript:** Confirms active participation in arrest, inventory, and tow, directly contradicting Ernstsen's solo claim. Strengthens Brady demand.
- **Defense Exhibit List:** Highlights Officer 2 omission and confirmation bias evidence.
- **Motion to Suppress:** Details confirmation bias, ineffective prior counsel, and Fourth Amendment issues.
- **Incident Report:** Based on context and reviewed documents, the incident report omits Officer 2 entirely, despite his documented involvement, constituting a Brady violation.

**Final Preparation:** This outline incorporates all reviewed text documents. Focus on Officer 2's omission as the strongest Brady issue, supported by transcript evidence.
