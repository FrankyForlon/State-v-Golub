## HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT

This is a **three-role practice script** for the February 17, 2026 pretrial conference. It contains the exact words for:

- **DEFENSE (Peter Golub, pro se)** — what you should say
- **PROSECUTION (Joseph C. Johnson, Deputy DA)** — anticipated responses based on his prior correspondence and standard prosecution tactics
- **COURT (Judge Hruby-Mills)** — likely judicial questions, prompts, and rulings

**For NotebookLM / AI practice:** Paste this entire document. Assign roles. Practice the back-and-forth verbally. The script includes both favorable and unfavorable judicial responses so you can rehearse both scenarios.

## SCENE SETTING

*Third District Court, Salt Lake County. Pretrial conference. The case is called.*

---

## OPENING

**COURT:** "State of Utah versus Peter Dmitry Golub, case number 235900706. This is set for a pretrial conference. Counsel, please state your appearances."

**PROSECUTION:** "Good morning, Your Honor. Joseph Johnson, Deputy District Attorney, on behalf of the State."

**DEFENSE:** "Good morning, Your Honor. Peter Golub, defendant, appearing pro se. I have six issues I would like to address for the Court today: first, trial logistics and readiness; second, my pending Motion to Compel regarding the second officer, Trooper Carpenter; third, outstanding Intoxilyzer discovery; fourth, the pending jury instruction disputes; fifth, my request to bifurcate the enhancement allegation; and finally, voir dire and courtroom technology. I will be as efficient as possible."

**COURT:** "Thank you, Mr. Golub. Let's take these in order. Go ahead with your first item."

---

## ISSUE 1: TRIAL LOGISTICS & READINESS
*(Target: 2-3 minutes. Easy consensus item. Build goodwill with the Court.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, my understanding is that trial is currently set for March 31, 2026, pursuant to the prior stipulated continuance. I am planning to be ready on that date, subject to the timely resolution of the discovery matters we will discuss today. I would ask the State to confirm on the record whether they also anticipate being ready for trial that week."

**PROSECUTION:** "The State is planning to be ready for March 31st, Your Honor. Corporal Ernstsen has confirmed his availability for that date."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you. I would also ask the Court to confirm whether a new jury panel will be summoned, since the January 22nd panel was released. And I would propose that we set deadlines: final witness and exhibit lists exchanged by March 21st, and any motions in limine filed by March 24th. That gives both parties and the Court a full week before trial."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, any objection to those deadlines?"

**PROSECUTION:** "No objection, Your Honor. Those dates are reasonable."

**COURT:** "All right. Trial is confirmed for March 31st. A new panel will be summoned. Witness and exhibit lists due March 21st, motions in limine by March 24th. Next issue."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor."

---

## ISSUE 2: MOTION TO COMPEL — TROOPER VINCENT CARPENTER
*(Target: 8-10 minutes. This is the first substantive fight.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, my second item is my Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding Second Officer, which I filed on February 12th. This concerns a second UHP trooper who was present for my entire arrest on September 6th and 7th of 2023.

For over two years, I have asked the State to identify this officer. He is visible on body-worn camera for over three and a half hours. He participated in the investigation, conducted the primary search of my vehicle, and handled the tow and impound process. Yet he is not mentioned in any police report, not in the DUI report, not in the crime report, not in the probable cause affidavit, and he is not on any witness list.

I have now identified him myself. The Vehicle Impound Report — which is in the State's own case file — is signed by Trooper Vincent Carpenter of the Utah Highway Patrol, same agency as Corporal Ernstsen, same case number, same date and location. That is Exhibit A to my motion.

I am asking the Court to order the State to: one, confirm on the record that Trooper Carpenter was the second officer on scene; and two, produce by March 17, 2026, any reports, notes, CAD or dispatch logs, impound documentation, and Evidence.com manifests or metadata authored by him. If such materials do not exist or cannot be produced, I am asking for a written certification explaining what was searched, whether any records were destroyed or never created, and what the retention policies are."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, what is the State's position on this motion?"

---

### PROSECUTION RESPONSE — SCENARIO A (Minimal Opposition)

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, I'm not aware of any reports authored by Trooper Carpenter in this case. The primary officer, Corporal Ernstsen, authored the DUI report, the crime report, and the probable cause affidavit. If no supplemental report was written, I can't produce what doesn't exist. I don't think this motion is necessary."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, if no report exists, that is itself a critical fact for trial. An officer was present for hours, participated in the investigation and the vehicle search, signed the impound report, and yet left no written record of anything he observed. A written certification of that fact is the appropriate remedy under Rule 16. It takes the State very little effort to check with UHP and confirm what records exist.

Additionally, I have not received any Evidence.com manifest or metadata for Trooper Carpenter's camera. I have approximately three and a half hours of what appears to be his body-cam footage, but I have no way to know whether that is the complete recording, whether any files were deleted or archived, or what other recordings exist. That metadata is clearly material to preparing the defense and is required under Rule 16(a)."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, can the State simply check with UHP and provide a response? If there's nothing to produce, a brief certification should be straightforward."

**PROSECUTION:** "We can make that inquiry, Your Honor."

**COURT:** "All right. I'm going to grant the motion. Mr. Johnson, the State is ordered to produce any reports, notes, CAD logs, or Evidence.com metadata authored by or related to Trooper Carpenter by March 17th. If no such materials exist, the State will provide a written certification explaining why. Is that clear?"

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor."

---

### PROSECUTION RESPONSE — SCENARIO B (Strong Opposition)

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, this is a fishing expedition. The defendant has the body-cam footage. He's acknowledged that. He has the impound report. Corporal Ernstsen is the only officer the State intends to call. We've provided all the discovery we have. We are not obligated to go on a scavenger hunt for materials that may not even exist just because the defendant can identify a second officer on video."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, this is not a fishing expedition; it is a request for basic, required discovery. The State's obligations under Rule 16 and under Brady and Giglio are not limited to the witnesses the State intends to call. They extend to the entire prosecution team, and UHP is part of that team.

Trooper Carpenter was not a passerby. He was intimately involved in this investigation for hours. He conducted the primary search of my vehicle. He signed the impound paperwork. And yet every piece of written documentation — the DUI report, the crime report, the probable cause affidavit — tells a single-officer story. The assisting officer field is left blank or says 'See DUI Report.' That omission is not a minor oversight. It raises serious questions about the completeness and accuracy of the entire investigation, and those are questions I am entitled to explore at trial.

If there are no Carpenter records, fine — certify it. That certification itself becomes part of the trial record. But if records do exist and have not been produced, that is a Rule 16 violation and potentially a Brady violation. Either way, the Court should order the inquiry."

**COURT:** "I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Golub that this is a reasonable request. Mr. Johnson, the State is ordered to make the inquiry and either produce what exists or certify what does not. Deadline is March 17th."

**PROSECUTION:** "Understood, Your Honor."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor. I would also ask the Court to note on the record that failure to produce or explain Carpenter's materials by March 17th prejudices my ability to prepare cross-examination and evaluate impeachment issues before the March 31st trial."

**COURT:** "So noted. Let's move on."

---

### PROSECUTION RESPONSE — SCENARIO C (Motion Denied)

**COURT:** "Mr. Golub, I've reviewed your motion. I think the State has provided the discovery it has. I'm going to deny the motion at this time. The defendant has the body-cam footage and can use it at trial."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, I respectfully disagree, and I would like to preserve my objection for the record. The Defense's Motion to Compel is based on Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1) and (a)(3), as well as the constitutional obligations under Brady v. Maryland and Giglio v. United States. The omission of a second officer from all written reports, when video evidence shows him present and active for the entire investigation, is directly material to the defense's ability to cross-examine and impeach the State's witness.

I am preserving this issue and will renew it at trial. Thank you, Your Honor."

**COURT:** "Noted. Next issue."

---

## ISSUE 3: OUTSTANDING INTOXILYZER DISCOVERY
*(Target: 5-7 minutes. This directly attacks the State's primary evidence.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, the third issue is outstanding discovery regarding the Intoxilyzer 8000, serial number 80-003421. The reliability of this breath test instrument is the central contested issue in this case. I am still missing three critical categories of evidence.

First, I have not received the COBRA data — the Computerized Online Breath Archives — which is the digital record of the test sequence for my specific test. This data would show the flow rates, timing, any aborted attempts, and any error codes or diagnostic messages. This is essential because the test slip shows a 144-second continuous blow, which would require over 21 liters of air — more than four times human lung capacity. The COBRA data would show what actually happened during that test.

Second, I have not received the complete maintenance and error logs for this instrument for the period surrounding September 2023. I need more than just certification dates — I need the actual service calls, malfunctions, recalibrations, and error history.

Third — and this is significant — the State's own Exhibit List, filed April 4, 2025, identifies two specific documents as trial exhibits: Certification Report for Intoxilyzer 8000/9000, Serial Number 80-003421, dated August 16, 2023, and a second one dated September 19, 2023. The State intends to use these documents at trial, but they have never been provided to me. I cannot prepare to challenge documents I have never seen.

I am asking the Court to order production of all three categories by March 10, 2026."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson?"

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, the defendant has the test result. He has the test slip. The certification reports are standard documents showing the machine was in working order. I'm not sure the COBRA data is even something we have readily available — that may need to come from the Department of Public Safety."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, two responses. First, regarding the certification reports: if the State lists them as trial exhibits, they must be produced under Rule 16. The Defense is entitled to see precisely what the State plans to show the jury, not merely a title on an exhibit list. Listing documents as exhibits without producing them is a clear discovery violation.

Second, regarding the COBRA data: the State chose to rely on a breath test as its primary evidence of guilt. The underlying data for that test is in the custody of the State's own agency, the Utah Department of Public Safety. If the State intends to stand behind that test result, it must make the supporting data available. Telling the Defense 'we don't have it handy' is not an adequate response when the State's entire case rests on a single number from this machine."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, it seems reasonable that if the State is going to use the test result and the certification reports at trial, the defense is entitled to see the underlying data. Can the State produce the COBRA data and the certifications?"

**PROSECUTION:** "We can request the COBRA data from DPS, Your Honor. And I'll locate the certification reports."

**COURT:** "The State is ordered to produce the COBRA data for the Intoxilyzer test in this case, the maintenance and error logs for the instrument for a reasonable period surrounding September 2023, and the two certification reports listed on the State's Exhibit List, by March 10, 2026. If any of those items are unavailable, the State will provide a written explanation by the same date."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor. I would also ask the Court to indicate that if those documents are not produced by the deadline, the Defense will seek exclusion of the certification reports as trial exhibits and will move to limit or preclude the State's arguments regarding the machine's presumed reliability."

**COURT:** "The remedy for any failure to comply will be addressed if and when it arises. But the State is on notice."

---

### ALTERNATE — IF COURT MINIMIZES THE REQUEST

**COURT:** "Mr. Golub, do you really need the COBRA data? You have the test slip and the result."

**DEFENSE:** "Yes, Your Honor, I do. The test slip shows a result of .104 and a 144-second test time. A 144-second continuous breath is physiologically impossible — it would require more than 21 liters of air from lungs that hold less than 5. The COBRA data would show the actual flow rate, whether there were multiple attempts, whether the machine flagged errors, and whether this result reflects a single valid sample or an aggregation of failed attempts. Without that data, I cannot meaningfully challenge the test, and my Sixth Amendment right to confront the evidence against me is impaired."

**COURT:** "Fair enough. The State will produce the COBRA data by March 10th."

---

## ISSUE 4: JURY INSTRUCTIONS
*(Target: 5-7 minutes. The most legally significant dispute.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, the fourth issue concerns the pending jury instruction disputes from the January filings. The Defense's objections to the State's proposed instructions and our proposed Defense Instructions 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 have been pending since October.

The central dispute is the State's proposed 'affirmative findings' instruction. This instruction tells the jury that the Court has made affirmative findings regarding the Intoxilyzer — essentially that the instrument is presumed reliable. Your Honor, the proper functioning of this machine is the most contested fact in this case. Corporal Ernstsen himself admitted, under oath on December 31, 2024, that 'the defendant would not properly blow into the machine, so we had to make several attempts.' The video shows a 144-second blow that is biologically impossible. Whether the machine was functioning properly is not something that should be presumed — it is what the jury must decide.

Under State v. Bradley, the Court cannot comment on contested facts. An instruction that tells the jury the Court has made findings about the Intoxilyzer's reliability is an improper judicial comment on the most contested fact in this case. It also shifts the burden to the defense to rebut a presumption, which is inconsistent with the presumption of innocence and the State's obligation to prove every element beyond a reasonable doubt.

My proposed instructions keep the burden where it belongs. They tell the jury that they are the sole judges of the weight of all evidence, including scientific instruments, and that the State must prove the test's reliability beyond a reasonable doubt.

I am asking the Court to either rule today that it will not give the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction, or to set a firm date for a final instructions conference well before trial, so both sides can shape voir dire, opening, and closing around the final instructions."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, what's the State's position on the instruction dispute?"

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, this is a standard instruction. The Intoxilyzer 8000 is a state-approved device. The instruction simply reflects that the instrument has been approved and certified for use. It is not commenting on a contested fact — it is stating a legal reality. The defense can argue to the jury that the test was flawed, but the instruction itself is appropriate."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, the instruction does far more than acknowledge that the Intoxilyzer is an approved device. It tells the jury that the Court has made 'affirmative findings' regarding its functioning. That puts the Court's authority behind the State's evidence. When an officer has already admitted the test was done improperly, and when there is evidence of a physically impossible test time, the jury should be free to weigh that evidence without being told the Court has already found the machine reliable.

My proposed instruction is neutral. It says: the jury is the sole judge of what weight to give the test result, and the State must prove its accuracy and reliability beyond a reasonable doubt. That is black-letter law on burden of proof. The State's proposed instruction inverts it."

**COURT — SCENARIO A (Rules for Defense):** "I'm inclined to agree that the 'affirmative findings' language is problematic given the specific facts of this case. I'll use neutral language regarding the Intoxilyzer. We'll settle the final instructions at a conference — let's set that for March 24th."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor."

**COURT — SCENARIO B (Defers):** "I'm not going to rule on final instructions today. We'll address this closer to trial. But I've reviewed your objections and your proposed instructions, and they'll be part of the record."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor. For the record, I am renewing and preserving my objections to the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction under State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292, and renewing my request for Defense Instructions 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. I will renew these objections before instructions are read at trial."

**COURT — SCENARIO C (Rules for State):** "I think the instruction as proposed is within the range of acceptable instructions. I'll give it."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, I respectfully object. This instruction shifts the burden of proof on the reliability of the State's primary evidence to the defense, in violation of the presumption of innocence. It also constitutes an improper judicial comment on a contested fact under State v. Bradley. I am preserving this objection and will renew it at trial. Thank you."

---

## ISSUE 5: BIFURCATION OF THE ENHANCEMENT
*(Target: 3 minutes. Important for jury fairness.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, my fifth item is a request to bifurcate the enhancement allegation. The State seeks a second-offense DUI enhancement based on a prior conviction. Under Rule 404(b), evidence of other crimes or acts is inadmissible to prove propensity. If the jury hears about a prior DUI conviction before deciding guilt on the current charge, the prejudice is significant and likely incurable.

I am requesting that the jury decide guilt on the underlying DUI and failure-to-signal charges first, without hearing about any prior conviction. If, and only if, the jury returns a guilty verdict on the DUI, then the enhancement can be addressed separately."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson?"

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, the State is willing to bifurcate. We've previously indicated that we would agree to address the enhancement separately."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you. I appreciate the State's agreement."

**COURT:** "Bifurcation is granted. The jury will decide the underlying charges first. The enhancement will be addressed only in the event of a guilty verdict on the DUI count."

---

### ALTERNATE — IF PROSECUTION OBJECTS

**PROSECUTION:** "Your Honor, the enhancement is an element of the charged offense. The State must prove it. The jury should hear all the evidence."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, the enhancement is a status element — it speaks to the defendant's history, not to what happened on September 6, 2023. It does not make it more or less likely that I was impaired on the night in question. Its only effect is to suggest propensity, which is precisely what Rule 404(b) prohibits. Bifurcation protects both parties: the State can still prove its enhancement if it first proves the underlying offense."

**COURT:** "I'm going to grant bifurcation. The prior conviction will not be mentioned during the guilt phase."

---

## ISSUE 6: VOIR DIRE & COURTROOM TECHNOLOGY
*(Target: 3-5 minutes. Practical matters.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, my final items are voir dire time and courtroom technology.

First, I am requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves a 144-second breath test anomaly, an officer with a 24-times-average arrest rate, and complex scientific evidence regarding the Intoxilyzer 8000. I need adequate time to identify and question jurors on their biases regarding scientific evidence, machine reliability, and officer credibility. I will be efficient, but I need enough time to seat a fair jury."

**COURT:** "How much time is the State requesting?"

**PROSECUTION:** "We'd be fine with 20 to 30 minutes each, Your Honor."

**COURT:** "I'll give each side 30 minutes for voir dire. If you need more time, Mr. Golub, you can request it, but plan for 30."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor. I'll work within 30 minutes.

Second, I request permission to use a laptop and projector during trial for PowerPoint presentations. These will be demonstrative exhibits used during opening statement and closing argument. They illustrate timelines, the scientific evidence regarding the breath test, and other evidence already in the record. They do not introduce any new evidence. I'm happy to provide the State with a copy of my slides in advance."

**COURT:** "Mr. Johnson, any objection?"

**PROSECUTION:** "No objection, provided we receive the slides at least 24 hours before trial."

**COURT:** "That's fine. Mr. Golub, you may use PowerPoint. Provide the State with your slides by March 30th. The courtroom has an HDMI connection. Coordinate with my clerk, Mr. Ciucci Liuzzi, about setup."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you, Your Honor. I will coordinate with the clerk. May I also confirm that email service on Mr. Johnson and the Hruby-Mills team remains acceptable for my filings?"

**COURT:** "Yes, email service is fine."

**DEFENSE:** "Thank you. Those are all my issues for today, Your Honor."

---

## CLOSING & SUMMARY

**COURT:** "Anything else from either party?"

**PROSECUTION:** "Nothing from the State, Your Honor."

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, just to summarize my requests for the record: I am asking for a ruling on the Motion to Compel regarding Trooper Carpenter's records by March 17th; a production order for the Intoxilyzer COBRA data, logs, and certification reports by March 10th; a ruling or schedule on the jury instructions; bifurcation of the enhancement; 30 minutes for voir dire; and approval to use PowerPoint at trial. Thank you for your time."

**COURT:** "Thank you, Mr. Golub. We'll be in recess."

---

## MASTER RECORD PRESERVATION SCRIPT
*(Use this if ANY key ruling goes against you. Say it before the hearing ends.)*

**DEFENSE:** "Your Honor, before we conclude, for the clarity of the record I am formally preserving the following objections and requests:

One — my Motion to Compel production of Trooper Carpenter's records under Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 and under Brady v. Maryland and Giglio v. United States;

Two — my objections to the State's proposed 'affirmative findings' jury instruction under State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292;

Three — my request for Defense Jury Instructions numbers 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11;

Four — my request for bifurcation of the enhancement allegation under Rule 404(b);

Five — my demand for COBRA data, complete Intoxilyzer maintenance and error logs, and the two certification reports listed on the State's Exhibit List;

I will renew all of these at trial. Thank you, Your Honor."

## APPENDIX: QUICK RESPONSES TO COMMON PROSECUTION TACTICS

### If Johnson suggests you should get a lawyer:
> "I appreciate the suggestion, Your Honor, but I am exercising my constitutional right to represent myself and I am prepared to proceed."

### If Johnson says "we've already provided everything":
> "Your Honor, the State's Exhibit List names documents that have not been provided. The State has not produced COBRA data. And a second officer's records have never been disclosed. 'Everything we have' is not the same as 'everything that exists and is required under Rule 16.'"

### If Johnson calls something a "fishing expedition":
> "Requesting records from an identified officer who spent hours at the scene and signed official documents is not a fishing expedition. It is basic discovery. I have identified the officer, the documents, and the legal basis. Rule 16 requires production."

### If Johnson argues the breath test is "standard" and needs no further foundation:
> "The officer himself testified the test was done improperly. The test time of 144 seconds is physically impossible. These are not standard circumstances. The underlying data — COBRA, logs, certifications — is what would show whether the machine functioned properly. Without it, there is no foundation."

### If the judge asks "can't you just cross-examine the officer about this?":
> "Your Honor, effective cross-examination requires knowing what documents exist. I cannot ask 'why didn't you create a report?' if I don't know whether a report was created. And I cannot confront the officer with the COBRA data if I've never seen it. Discovery is a prerequisite to meaningful cross-examination, not a substitute for it."

### If Johnson objects to your PowerPoint:
> "The slides are demonstrative aids summarizing evidence already in the record — report excerpts, video timestamps, and legal standards. They do not introduce new evidence. I am willing to share them in advance."
