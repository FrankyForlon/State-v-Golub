# PRETRIAL PLAN FOR FEBRUARY 17, 2026
## State v. Golub, Case No. 235900706 | Judge Hruby-Mills

---

## OPENING (30 seconds)

"Good afternoon, Your Honor. I have six items for today: trial logistics, the pending Motion to Compel regarding Trooper Carpenter's bodycam footage, outstanding discovery, jury instruction disputes, bifurcation of the enhancement, and voir dire and technology. I'll be efficient."

---

## STRATEGIC ORDER
*(Easy wins first, build to the contentious issues)*

---

### ISSUE 1: TRIAL LOGISTICS (2 minutes)

**Confirm on the record:**
- Trial date: March 31, 2026
- Voir dire start time (8:30 AM or 9:00 AM?)
- Courtroom assignment
- Expected trial length: 2 days (March 31 - April 1?)
- New jury panel will be summoned (January 22 panel was released)
- Defendant will be present and representing pro se

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'd like to confirm on the record: trial is set for March 31, 2026. Can the Court confirm the start time, courtroom, and whether we have a second day if needed? And I assume a new jury panel will be summoned?"

---

### ISSUE 2: MOTION TO COMPEL — TROOPER CARPENTER'S BODYCAM (10 minutes)

**Background for the Court:**
The Defense filed a Motion to Compel production of bodycam footage and records from a second UHP officer present during the September 6, 2023 arrest. The Defense has independently identified this officer as **Trooper Vincent Carpenter** from the Vehicle Impound Report in the State's own case file.

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I've filed a Motion to Compel regarding the second officer present during my arrest. For over two years, I've been asking the State to identify this officer. He's visible on video for over three and a half hours. He participated in the arrest, searched my vehicle, handled the tow. He's not in any police report. He's not on any witness list.

I've now identified him myself. The Vehicle Impound Report — in the State's own file — is signed by Trooper Vincent Carpenter of the Utah Highway Patrol. Same agency as Corporal Ernstsen. Same case number.

I'm not asking to call Trooper Carpenter as a witness. I'm asking for his bodycam footage. Under Brady, the State is required to produce evidence that may be exculpatory or useful for impeachment. A second officer's bodycam footage of the entire encounter is clearly both.

I request the Court order production by March 17th — two weeks before trial. If the footage doesn't exist or has been destroyed, I request a written explanation and an adverse inference instruction."

**If the State says they don't have it:**
"Your Honor, the State can direct UHP to produce Trooper Carpenter's bodycam footage. UHP retention policies typically preserve footage for active cases. This case is active. The footage should exist."

**If the State says it's irrelevant:**
"Your Honor, a second officer witnessed the entire encounter — including the 144-second breath test, the field sobriety tests, and the arrest. His footage is relevant to every element of the State's case. The jury is entitled to see what two officers saw, not just the one the State chose to put in the report."

---

### ISSUE 3: OUTSTANDING DISCOVERY (5 minutes)

**Still Outstanding:**

| Item | Status | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|---------------|
| COBRA Data | NOT RECEIVED | Flow rate data from the 144-second test — proves machine malfunction |
| Carpenter Bodycam | NOT PRODUCED | Second officer's perspective on entire encounter |
| Complete Intoxilyzer Logs | PARTIAL | Error logs beyond certification dates |

**Script:**
"Your Honor, beyond Trooper Carpenter's footage, I'm still missing the COBRA data — the Computerized Online Breath Archives. The Intoxilyzer 8000 stores digital flow rate and timing data for every test. This data would show exactly what happened during the 144-second test. The State has not produced it despite repeated requests.

I also need complete Intoxilyzer maintenance and error logs, not just the certification dates.

I request the Court set a production deadline of March 17, 2026 for all outstanding discovery."

---

### ISSUE 4: JURY INSTRUCTIONS (5 minutes)

**Do NOT refile.** The record is already built:
- October 2025: Defense instructions filed
- January 6, 2026: Objections to State's "affirmative findings" instruction filed
- January 8, 2026: Side-by-side comparison emailed to court and counsel

**Script:**
"Your Honor, the Defense's objections to the State's proposed jury instructions and our proposed Defense Instructions #6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 have been pending since October. Given the March 31 trial date, I respectfully request a ruling so both sides can prepare.

The central dispute is the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction. It tells the jury that the Court has made findings about the Intoxilyzer — but the officer himself admitted the test was improperly done, and the video shows a physiologically impossible 144-second blow. Whether the machine was functioning properly is the central contested fact. Under State v. Bradley, the Court cannot comment on contested facts.

I'm requesting either a ruling today or a deadline for the Court to address these before trial."

**If judge defers again:**
"Your Honor, I understand. For the record, I'm renewing and preserving my objections to the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction under State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292, and my request for Defense Instructions #6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. I'll renew these objections before instructions are read at trial."

---

### ISSUE 5: ENHANCEMENT / BIFURCATION (3 minutes)

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm renewing my request to bifurcate the enhancement allegation. The State seeks a second-offense enhancement based on a prior conviction. Under Rule 404(b), evidence of a prior conviction is inadmissible during the guilt phase to prove propensity. If the jury hears about a prior conviction before deciding guilt, it's prejudicial.

I request the jury decide guilt on the DUI charge first, without hearing about any prior. If there's a conviction, the Court can address the enhancement separately."

**If denied:**
"Your Honor, I'd request at minimum a limiting instruction that the jury may not consider the prior conviction as evidence of guilt on the current charge. I'm preserving this objection under Rule 404(b)."

---

### ISSUE 6: VOIR DIRE AND TECHNOLOGY (3 minutes)

**Voir Dire:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves a 144-second breath test anomaly and an officer with a 24-times-average arrest rate. I need adequate time to identify jurors who can fairly evaluate scientific evidence and officer credibility."

**Fallback:** "At minimum, I need 30 minutes. I'll be as efficient as possible."

**Technology:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting permission to use a laptop and projector during trial for PowerPoint presentations, video clips, timelines, and demonstrative exhibits. I can use my own equipment or the court's. May I have approval and arrive early to set up?"

---

## CLOSING (30 seconds)

"Your Honor, to summarize: I'm asking for a ruling on the Motion to Compel Trooper Carpenter's footage, a March 17 discovery deadline, a ruling on jury instructions, bifurcation of the enhancement, 45 minutes for voir dire, and technology approval. Thank you for your time."

---

## RECORD PRESERVATION SCRIPT (if needed)

"Your Honor, for the record, I'm preserving:
1. My Motion to Compel production of Trooper Carpenter's bodycam footage and records;
2. My objections to the State's 'affirmative findings' jury instruction under State v. Bradley;
3. My request for Defense Instructions #6, 7, 8, 10, and 11;
4. My request for bifurcation of the enhancement under Rule 404(b);
5. My demand for COBRA data and complete Intoxilyzer maintenance logs.
I will renew all of these at trial."
