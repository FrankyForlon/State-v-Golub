The following represents the Defense notes from the JANUARY 12, 2026
Pretrial: 

Defense: "Good afternoon, Your Honor. Before trial on January 22nd, we need to address seven issues: trial logistics, technology approval, witness and exhibit confirmation, the enhancement charge, voir dire time, and two jury instruction disputes. I'll be as efficient as possible."

Judge: “Counsel, how are we doing on the other four cases?” 

State: “We’re still working on the details.”

Judge: “Mr. Golub, is there anything you feel you need to say now?”

Def: “Yes, your Honor. I'd like to confirm on the record: trial is set for January 22-23, voir dire at 8:30 AM on Day 1, trial at 9:00 AM on Day 2, in this courtroom. Is that correct?"

J: “Voir Dire and Trial usually starts 8:30 a.m.”

Def: “Your Honor, I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves an officer whose DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average and a breath test that recorded a physiologically impossible 144-second continuous blow. Under State v. Perea, the Utah Supreme Court recognized that confirmation bias is real and affects investigations.

The jury needs to understand these issues, and I need adequate time to identify jurors who can fairly evaluate scientific evidence and officer credibility. Forty-five minutes is reasonable given the complexity.”

J: “I can’t just give you 45 minutes to speak. Is that what you’re asking?” 

D: “I’d just like adequate time to ask potential jurors about the specifics of the case. Jurors need to understand that a 144-second continuous blow is physiologically anomalous. There is the issue of officer Credibility/Confirmation Bias. Under State v. Perea, 2013 UT 68, confirmation bias is a recognized—” 

J: “Mr. Golub I won’t let you speak for 45 minutes.” 

D: “May I at least have 30 minutes to ask questions?” 

J: “When it comes to questions, that decision will be made during Voir Dire. I can’t discuss specific questions or times now.” 

D: “Thank you, your Honor. In terms of the technology, I'm requesting permission to use a laptop and the court's projector to display video clips, timelines, and demonstrative exhibits during trial. This will help the jury follow complex technical evidence. I can provide my equipment or use the court's. May I have approval?"

[Judge turns to Joseph Ciucci Liuzzi, Judicial Assistant for Judge Hruby-Mills] 

Judicial Assistant: “You’ll plug into that computer there [indicates monitor on table behind which Mr. Golub is sitting]. Everyone will be able to see it. The Jury will see it on the court display.” 

J: “But that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to show everything you want. I’ll have to decide whether it is admissible or not.” 

D: “Yes, I have submitted an exhibit list. I was under the impression I could show that evidence.” 

J: “We may require further discussion on specifics.” 

D: “Thank you, I am ready to discuss any details. Your Honor, I'd also like to confirm witness lists. The State's list shows only Corporal Ernstsen. Is that correct? Will the State be calling the second officer who appears in the video evidence or can I just show his bodycam video?"

J: “Counsel, have you made a decision on this?” 

Prosecution: “Not as of now, your Honor.” 

J: “We can discuss these details on Friday.” 

D: “Friday?” 

J: “Counsel, defer to Friday?” 

P: “Yes, your Honor, State should have more information by then.” 

J: “Anymore questions, Mr. Golub?” 

D: “Yes, in the State’s Enhancement, the reference is to a prior DUI, but it was in fact, reckless driving.” 

J: “I believe it’s impaired. Counsel?” 

P: “Yes. Impaired. It’s the same thing.” 

D: “Wait how is a DUI the same thing as impaired? What’s the—” 

J: “Anything else, Mr. Golub?”

D: “Well, yes, your Honor. The main issue I wanted to discuss were the Jury Instructions. The State’s instructions are highly prejudicial. I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves an officer whose DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average and a breath test that recorded a physiologically impossible 144-second continuous blow. Under State v. Perea—”

J: “You’ve already brought up the Voir Dire issue and like I previously noted, this will be addressed during Voir Dire.” 

D: “Your Honor, the State's proposed instruction on page 29 tells the jury that this Court has made 'affirmative findings' about the Intoxilyzer and that there's a 'rebuttable presumption' it was functioning properly. This is reversible error under State v. Bradley...”

J: “Yes, we can address the Instructions on Friday. But you won’t have to appear in person.” 

D: “I’m confused. What’s happening on Friday.” 

J: [to Judicial Assistant] “Can you send Mr. Golub the link for the video conference today?” 

Judicial Assistant: “Yes, your Honor, I can do this now.” 

J: “Mr. Golub, make sure to check your email, okay? All the details will also be available online. Do you have access to MyCase?” 

D: “Yes, that’s how I’ve been doing the case the entire time.” 

J: “Good. You won’t need to appear in person but make sure you get the link and know how to use it. Any more questions, Mr. Golub?” 

D: “No, your Honor.” 

J: “Will Counsel be ready on Friday?” 

P: “Yes, your Honor.” 

J: “Okay, Mr. Golub. Make sure to use that link, and we will see you on Friday.” 

D: “Thank you, your Honor.”
