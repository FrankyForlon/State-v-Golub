Dear Counsel,

In preparation for the trial beginning January 22, and the pretrial hearing in six days, I am attaching my Specific Objections to the State’s Proposed Jury Instructions and a Side-by-Side Comparison of our proposed languages.

I am requesting we resolve the following prior to the hearing:

1. Jury Instructions: As detailed in the attachments, the Defense formally objects to the State’s proposed instruction that "the Court has made affirmative findings" regarding the Intoxilyzer. This constitutes an improper judicial comment on the evidence. I have provided neutral alternative language.

2. Missing Discovery (Officer 2): The evidentiary record includes bodycam/dashcam footage from a second officer involved in the arrest, yet this officer is not named in the reports. Could you please identify this officer. If not, the Defense requests a stipulation to the authenticity of his footage for use at trial.

3. Voir Dire: The Defense requests 45 minutes for voir dire, specifically to address juror bias regarding police officer credibility vs. civilian credibility.

4.      Trial Tech: I will be using PowerPoint with embedded video/transcripts. Please confirm you have no objection to the use of printed transcripts as demonstrative jury aids.

I am available for all correspondence (email, phone, in-person) before the hearing to discuss stipulations regarding the admissibility of the video evidence. I can arrive early to meet you on the day of pretrial or on another day when you are in court and have a free moment. My number is 801-618-7609.

Respectfully,

Peter Golub
