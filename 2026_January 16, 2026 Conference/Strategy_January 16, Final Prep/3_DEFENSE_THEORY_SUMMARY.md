# DEFENSE THEORY SUMMARY - STATE v. GOLUB

## THE THREE PILLARS OF DEFENSE

### PILLAR 1: THE 144-SECOND BREATH TEST ANOMALY

**The Core Argument:**
The Intoxilyzer 8000 test recorded a 144-second continuous breath sample - a physiological impossibility that proves the test was invalid, the machine malfunctioned, or the protocol was manipulated.

**Key Evidence:**
- **Video Evidence:** Bodycam shows continuous 144-second "blow" (7-9x normal maximum of 12-20 seconds)
- **Physiological Impossibility:** Human vital capacity is ~4.8 liters. A 144-second blow at minimum flow rate (0.15 L/s) requires 21.6 liters - 4.5x human capacity
- **Officer's Admission:** Ernstsen testified: "The defendant would not properly blow into the machine, so we had to make several attempts" (Dec 31, 2024 hearing)
- **Single Sample:** R714-500-6(E) requires two samples agreeing within 0.020 g/210L - only one sample taken
- **No Reset/Retest:** Officer failed to reset machine or conduct blood draw when anomaly occurred
- **Result:** 0.104 g/210L from corrupted single sample

**Legal Authority:**
- **Utah Admin. Code R714-500-6(A)(3):** "Breath specimen analyzed shall be essentially alveolar or end expiratory in composition"
  - A 144-second sample cannot be "essentially alveolar" - it exceeds biological limits by 400%+
- **Intoxilyzer 8000 Manual:** Standard test is 4-6 seconds, maximum ~20 seconds
- **Case Law:** State v. Schmidt (Ohio 2015), State v. Swindle (Fla. 2015) - courts have suppressed Intoxilyzer results for procedural violations

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "The machine produced a number, that's all that matters"
  - **Counter:** The number is meaningless if the test violated scientific protocols. A thermometer reading taken in an oven isn't valid either.
- State will argue: "The defendant was uncooperative"
  - **Counter:** Even if true, uncooperation doesn't make a 144-second blow physiologically possible. The officer should have recognized machine failure and drawn blood.
- State will argue: "The code doesn't specify a maximum time"
  - **Counter:** The "essentially alveolar" requirement incorporates biological limits. Expert testimony will establish 12-20 seconds as the physiological maximum.

### PILLAR 2: 24X ARREST RATE BIAS (CONFIRMATION BIAS)

**The Core Argument:**
Corporal Ernstsen's DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average, demonstrating confirmation bias under State v. Perea. This bias explains why he ignored the impossible 144-second test and failed to follow proper procedures.

**Key Evidence:**
- **GRAMA Data:** Ernstsen's stop-to-arrest ratio is 24x state average
- **Pattern of Behavior:** Officer "very familiar with the location of nearly every bar" and patrols "areas with bars and nightclubs" (KSL article)
- **Tunnel Vision:** Officer ignored physiological impossibility of 144-second blow, failed to reset machine, failed to draw blood
- **Omission of Officer 2:** Failed to document second officer's 3.5-hour involvement - suggests pattern of incomplete/inaccurate reporting
- **Selective Documentation:** Documented 6/6 HGN clues (subjective, unverifiable) but 0/4 One-Leg Stand clues (objective, verifiable on video)

**Legal Authority:**
- **State v. Perea, 2013 UT 68:** Utah Supreme Court acknowledged confirmation bias as real psychological phenomenon affecting police investigations
- **Application:** Officer's 24x arrest rate + failure to recognize 144-second impossibility = tunnel vision bias
- **Jury Instruction Needed:** Defense Instruction #6 on confirmation bias and evaluating officer credibility

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "High arrest rate shows he's good at his job"
  - **Counter:** A 24x average suggests targeting, not skill. If he were that good, his cases wouldn't have acquittals and dismissals.
- State will argue: "Past cases are irrelevant"
  - **Counter:** Pattern of behavior is relevant to credibility and bias. The 24x rate explains why he ignored the impossible test result.
- State will argue: "This is character assassination"
  - **Counter:** This is about credibility and bias, not character. The evidence shows a pattern that explains his actions in this case.

### PILLAR 3: 80+ MINUTES WITHOUT MIRANDA

**The Core Argument:**
Mr. Golub was in custody from minute 5 (ordered out of vehicle) but Miranda warnings were not given until minute 85 (at jail). This 80-minute period of unwarned custodial interrogation violates the Fifth Amendment.

**Key Evidence:**
- **Timeline:**
  - Minute 0: Traffic stop
  - Minute 5: Ordered out of vehicle (custody begins under Berkemer v. McCarty)
  - Minute 28: Handcuffed
  - Minute 85: Miranda warnings given at jail
- **Custodial Interrogation:** Officer asked questions about drinking, where coming from, etc. during unwarned period
- **Video Evidence:** Bodycam/dashcam show timeline clearly
- **Legal Standard:** Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984) - traffic stop can become custody

**Legal Authority:**
- **Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984):** Traffic stop becomes custody when reasonable person would not feel free to leave
- **State v. Mirquet, 914 P.2d 1144 (Utah 1996):** FSTs can constitute custody
- **Application:** Once ordered out and handcuffed, custody clearly established

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "Traffic stops aren't custody"
  - **Counter:** True initially, but once ordered out and handcuffed, custody clearly established. Berkemer recognizes this distinction.
- State will argue: "No interrogation occurred"
  - **Counter:** Questions about drinking, where coming from, etc. constitute interrogation. Video shows this clearly.
- State will argue: "Statements were voluntary"
  - **Counter:** Even if voluntary, Miranda still required once custody established. The violation is procedural, not about voluntariness.

## INTEGRATED DEFENSE THEORY

**The Narrative:**
An officer with 24 times the normal arrest rate stopped Mr. Golub based on a questionable traffic violation. Predetermined to find guilt, the officer ignored an impossible 144-second breath test result, failed to follow proper procedures (no reset, no blood draw), and violated Miranda rights. The only physical evidence - a single corrupted breath test - is unreliable because it violated scientific protocols.

**How the Pillars Support Each Other:**
1. **Pillar 1 (144-second test)** shows the officer ignored scientific impossibility
2. **Pillar 2 (24x arrest rate)** explains WHY he ignored it (confirmation bias)
3. **Pillar 3 (Miranda violation)** shows pattern of procedural disregard

**The Closing:**
"When a DUI Task Force officer with 24 times the average arrest rate forces a physiologically impossible 144-second breath test, admits it wasn't properly done, then fails to draw blood or reset the machine - that's not good police work. That's confirmation bias. And when you add 80 minutes without Miranda, you have a case built on unreliable evidence obtained through improper procedures. The State cannot prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt when their only physical evidence comes from a broken process."

## WEAKNESSES TO ADDRESS

### Overall Weaknesses:
1. **No Expert Witness:** Defense cannot afford expert to testify about breath test science
   - **Mitigation:** Use scientific literature, manuals, and case law. Cross-examine officer on his lack of scientific training.

2. **Prior Conviction:** State will try to use 2019 reckless driving conviction
   - **Mitigation:** Argue it's not a DUI conviction, request bifurcated trial, emphasize it's propensity evidence

3. **BAC Result:** 0.104 is above legal limit
   - **Mitigation:** Attack the reliability of the test itself. If the test was invalid, the number is meaningless.

4. **Officer's Experience:** State will emphasize Ernstsen's training and experience
   - **Mitigation:** Use his experience against him - an experienced officer should have recognized the 144-second impossibility.

5. **Video Shows Some Indicators:** State will point to any signs of impairment on video
   - **Mitigation:** Emphasize perfect One-Leg Stand (0/4 clues), normal driving for 10 blocks, fatigue as alternative explanation.

### Specific Weaknesses by Pillar:

**Pillar 1 Weaknesses:**
- State may argue defendant was "pumping" air (inhaling/exhaling repeatedly)
  - **Counter:** That would violate "continuous sample" requirement and contaminate the sample
- State may produce maintenance records showing machine was calibrated
  - **Counter:** Calibration doesn't fix a 144-second anomaly. The test itself violated protocols.

**Pillar 2 Weaknesses:**
- Judge may limit evidence of past cases
  - **Counter:** Focus on the 24x statistic and how it explains current case behavior
- State will argue this is character assassination
  - **Counter:** This is about credibility and bias, not character. Pattern explains actions.

**Pillar 3 Weaknesses:**
- Statements may not be particularly incriminating
  - **Counter:** Still a Miranda violation. Even if statements aren't used, shows pattern of procedural disregard.
