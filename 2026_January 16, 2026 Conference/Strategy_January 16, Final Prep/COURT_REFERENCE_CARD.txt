# SIDE A: YOUR RIGHTS & MAGIC PHRASES

---

## IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND - SAY THIS:

> **"Your Honor, I don't fully understand what's happening. I'd like to request a brief recess to ensure I can preserve my constitutional rights and respond appropriately."**

Or shorter:

> **"Your Honor, I need a moment to understand the procedural posture before responding."**

---

## YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Right to Jury Trial** | You have it. Don't waive it. Bench trial = judge decides = bad for you. |
| **Right to Remain Silent** | You don't have to testify. Can't be held against you. |
| **Right to Confront Witnesses** | You can cross-examine anyone who testifies against you. |
| **Right to Present Defense** | You can call witnesses, present evidence, make arguments. |
| **Right to Due Process** | State must follow proper procedures. Object when they don't. |
| **Presumption of Innocence** | You're innocent until proven guilty. State has burden. |
| **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt** | Highest standard. "Probably guilty" isn't enough. |

---

## WHEN TO SAY "OBJECTION"

| Say This | When This Happens |
|----------|-------------------|
| **"Objection, relevance"** | Evidence has nothing to do with the charges |
| **"Objection, hearsay"** | Witness quotes what someone else said (not present) |
| **"Objection, leading"** | Prosecutor asks witness yes/no questions on direct |
| **"Objection, foundation"** | No proof document/evidence is what they say it is |
| **"Objection, speculation"** | Witness guessing, not stating facts |
| **"Objection, asked and answered"** | Same question asked multiple times |
| **"Objection, 404(b)"** | Prior bad acts used to show propensity |

**If objection sustained:** Evidence excluded. Good.
**If objection overruled:** Say "Exception noted" to preserve for appeal.

---

## PRESERVE THE RECORD - CRITICAL

After ANY adverse ruling, say:

> **"Your Honor, I'd like to note my objection for the record."**

Or:

> **"Exception noted, Your Honor."**

This preserves your right to appeal. If you don't object, you waive it.

---

## THE GOLDEN PHRASE (Memorize This)

> **"Your Honor, I don't understand the current procedural posture. I'd like to request a continuance so I can research the options available to me and ensure I preserve my constitutional rights."**

Use this ANY time you're confused. It's not weakness - it's smart.

---

## AT PRETRIAL - KEY PHRASES

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|-------------|
| Need something from State | "I have an outstanding discovery demand under Brady and Giglio." |
| State surprises you | "Your Honor, this wasn't disclosed. I request a continuance." |
| Judge won't rule | "I'm preserving this objection for the record." |
| Don't understand | "Your Honor, could you explain the procedural options available to me?" |
| Need time | "May I have a brief recess to consider my response?" |

---

## AT TRIAL - KEY MOMENTS

### When State Rests:
> **"Your Honor, the defense moves for a directed verdict. The State has failed to prove [element] beyond a reasonable doubt."**

### Before Jury Instructions Read:
> **"Your Honor, I renew my objections to the State's instruction on [topic] as previously stated on the record."**

### After Verdict (if guilty):
> **"Your Honor, the defense requests the Court poll the jury."**
> **"The defense gives notice of intent to appeal."**

## THINGS THAT WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS

| Action | What You Lose |

## YOUR CASE - QUICK FACTS TO REMEMBER

- **144 seconds** = physiologically impossible (need 21.6L, humans have 4.8L)
- **R714-500-6-A(3)** = sample must be "essentially alveolar"
- **State v. Bradley** = judge can't comment on contested facts
- **State v. Perea** = confirmation bias is real, jury can consider it
- **Officer's admission** = "improperly done" (Dec 31, 2024 transcript)
- **Officer 2** = present 3.5 hours, not in any report = Brady violation
- **24x arrest rate** = confirmation bias evidence
- **0/4 clues** = perfect One-Leg Stand performance

## EMERGENCY PHRASES

**If blindsided:**
> "Your Honor, I was not aware of this. I need time to respond appropriately."

**If prosecutor does something wrong:**
> "Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is [leading/misstating evidence/arguing facts not in evidence]."

**If you need a break:**
> "Your Honor, may we take a brief recess?"

**If you're losing and need to stop:**
> "Your Honor, I move for a mistrial based on [specific prejudicial error]."

**If judge seems biased:**
> "Your Honor, for the record, I'm objecting to [specific ruling] and preserving the issue for appeal."

---

## REMEMBER

1. **Stay calm.** Judges respect composure.
2. **Ask if confused.** It's your right.
3. **Object when needed.** Silence = waiver.
4. **Preserve the record.** Say "objection noted" after adverse rulings.
5. **You have a jury.** They decide facts, not the judge.
6. **State has the burden.** You don't have to prove anything.

**Good luck. You've prepared well. Trust your preparation.**


Trial Arguments & Strategies 

A.	Objections and Vocab

1.	Foundation — “Objection, lack of foundation for admissibility under Utah Code § 41-6a-515.”
2.	Hearsay — “Objection, hearsay not within an exception.”
3.	Relevance — “Objection, relevance under Rule 401.”
4.	Unfair Prejudice — “Objection, Rule 403 — probative value substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.”
5.	Improper Character Evidence — “Objection, Rule 404(b) — improper propensity argument.”

B.	General Arguments 

•	Both MILs Granted:
“Without science, they want you to convict on opinion. That’s not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”
•	Only BAC In:
“A number from a machine is only as good as the procedure behind it. Here, the procedure failed.”
•	Both Denied:
“The law forbids convicting on someone’s past — you must judge only the evidence from September 6, 2023.”

C.	Key Defense Arguments 

1.	Use field sobriety test to show that defendant could drive
-	As why he didn’t mark an error? Could it be that you weren’t testing? What makes you choose to cite (suspect leaned on door)? 


D.	Prosecution Argument ? Defense Counter)

1.	[Prosecution]   Trooper observed signs of impairment ? SFSTs confirm suspicion.
[Defense]       Officer deviated from NHTSA manual; conditions invalidated results.

2.	[Prosecution]   Intoxilyzer shows BAC above limit.
[Defense]       Device miscalibrated; certifications don’t match test date; no blood draw for confirmation.

3.	[Prosecution]   Defendant admitted to drinking.
[Defense]     Statement obtained without Miranda — inadmissible.

?
Decision Tree:

?
??? Judge grants BOTH MILs (exclude prior DUI + exclude BAC)
?     ?? Trial Theme: "State has no science, only shaky opinion."
?     ?? Opening Statement: Focus on bias, SFST unreliability, alternate explanations (fatigue, medication).
?     ?? Cross Ernstsen: Heavy on SFST deviations + lack of objective impairment cues.
?     ?? Closing: "Without BAC and with flawed SFSTs, there's nothing left beyond doubt."
?
??? Judge grants ONE MIL (likely BAC in, prior DUI out)
?     ?? Trial Theme: "Even the science here is flawed."
?     ?? Opening: Acknowledge BAC but frame as unreliable from start.
?     ?? Cross Ernstsen: Attack calibration, operator cert, environmental contamination.
?     ?? Expert testimony: Explain mouth alcohol + cold meds effect.
?     ?? Closing: "Even their machine can't be trusted."
?
??? Judge denies BOTH MILs (BAC in + prior DUI in)
?     ?? Trial Theme: "Don't be distracted by past; this case is about today."
?     ?? Opening: "The law says prior incidents can't prove guilt here."
?     ?? Immediate limiting instruction request re: prior DUI.
?     ?? Cross Ernstsen: Attack both SFST & BAC; emphasize fairness + due process.
?     ?? Closing: "You can't convict on the past, only on proof beyond doubt today."
