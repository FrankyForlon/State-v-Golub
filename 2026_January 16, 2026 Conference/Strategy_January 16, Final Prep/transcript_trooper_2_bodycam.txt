Remember that Ernstsen claimed that he was the only one on the scene. Also he used the world “disgusting” about the defendant again. 

[00:00:38:16] Speaker1: Adding [00:00:35:00] new shift entry.

[00:01:08:25] Speaker2: I [00:01:05:00] will. [00:01:10:00] Absolutely. I probably yeah, I [00:01:15:00] probably should have responded. I've been teaching since since 730 to [00:01:20:00] 830, that school district first, and then it's [00:01:25:00] Peter, right? Yes. So [00:01:30:00] I don't think you should be worried. Okay. And we'll we'll see if we can just [00:01:35:00] put your hands behind your back. We'll get him for that one. Salt [00:01:40:00] Lake 5983 1182 155. [00:01:45:00] Just [00:02:20:00] brighten [00:02:25:00] your stance for me. Let [00:02:35:00] me just lock these handcuffs so they don't turn on. [00:02:40:00] Okay. Thanks for being cooperative and respectful. I'll do the same. [00:02:45:00] Okay. I'm just gonna go over here.

[00:02:52:07] Speaker3: Watch [00:02:50:00] your step.

[00:03:19:16] Speaker2: Is [00:03:15:00] there any [00:03:20:00] way that the car could not be in Vegas? I have to find it. Like. [00:03:25:00] This [00:03:30:00] is just, you know, it's a horrible thing, [00:03:35:00] but it's happening. And I [00:03:40:00] can call someone and just pick it up in a minute. I understand, but by state statute, [00:03:45:00] when I arrest him for DUI. Yeah. All [00:03:50:00] right. Are you sure you don't want your phone and wallet? You want [00:03:55:00] everything left in the car? It's probably good to get your phone [00:04:00:00] to call somebody. All right. Can [00:04:05:00] I get my phone? Yeah, I'll go grab it. Well, can I just. No, I'll [00:04:10:00] go grab it. I'll take care of the info. Sure. [00:04:15:00] Yeah. Yeah, that's all good. It's. It's quick paperwork.

[00:04:30:05] Speaker4: Get [00:04:30:00] his driver's license.

[00:04:31:21] Speaker2: Oh, yeah. Oh, [00:04:45:00] I guess he could have ordered the Tahoe instead of me calling.

[00:04:49:17] Speaker4: That's all good. I'll [00:04:50:00] just do the paperwork. Sounds good. [00:04:55:00]

[00:05:37:05] Speaker2: Actually, [00:05:35:00] I guess, yeah, it might be [00:05:40:00] easier to just have you write down the inventory so you can transfer it to the. Yeah.
