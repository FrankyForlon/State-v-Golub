CRITICAL ADJUSTMENTS FROM JANUARY 12 HEARING
================================================================================

LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Judge cut off arguments quickly - be CONCISE
2. Judge deferred almost everything to "Friday" - this is your opportunity
3. Judge didn't want to discuss voir dire time in advance
4. Technology approved (plug into court computer)
5. State said they'd have witness info by Friday
6. Prosecutor claimed "impaired" = DUI for enhancement (challenge this)

NEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 12:
- Received juror questionnaire and appearance report
- Voir Dire confirmed: January 22 at 9:00 AM (juror check-in 8:30)
- Trial format clarified via court correspondence

================================================================================
OPENING STATEMENT (15 seconds - BE BRIEF)
================================================================================

"Good morning, Your Honor. Thank you for the Webex link. I have three matters
deferred from Monday: jury instructions, the State's witness decision, and
outstanding discovery. I'll be brief."

NOTE: Do NOT repeat requests already addressed (technology, trial logistics).
The Judge will remember you asked those on Monday.

================================================================================
PRIORITY 1: STATE'S WITNESS DECISION (1-2 minutes)
================================================================================

BACKGROUND:
- On January 12, State said they'd have witness decision "by Friday"
- Need to know: Is Officer 2 being called?
- This affects trial preparation significantly

SCRIPT:
"Your Honor, on Monday Mr. Johnson indicated he'd have the witness decision by
today. I'd like to confirm: Will the State be calling only Corporal Ernstsen,
or will Officer 2--the second officer present in the video--also be testifying?"

IF STATE STILL UNDECIDED:
"Your Honor, trial is in six days. I need to know who I'm cross-examining.
I request the Court set a deadline of today at 5 PM for the State to finalize
its witness list."

IF STATE SAYS THEY WON'T CALL OFFICER 2:
"Thank you. I'll note for the record that Officer 2 was present for over
three hours and actively participated in the arrest, vehicle search, and tow.
His absence from the witness list is relevant to the Brady issue I've raised."

================================================================================
PRIORITY 2: JURY INSTRUCTIONS (3-5 minutes)
================================================================================

THE CORE DISPUTE:
State's instruction (Page 29) tells jury the Court made "affirmative findings"
about the Intoxilyzer and creates a "rebuttable presumption" it worked properly.

WHY THIS IS WRONG (CONCISE VERSION):
1. The 144-second test is scientifically impossible
2. Officer admitted test was "improperly done"
3. Telling jury what to believe about contested evidence is error under Bradley

SCRIPT:
"Your Honor, I filed written objections to the State's jury instructions on
January 8th. The central dispute is the 'affirmative findings' instruction
on page 29.

The officer himself testified the test was 'improperly done.' The video shows
144 seconds of continuous blowing--that's physically impossible. Whether this
machine worked properly is the disputed fact in this case.

Under State v. Bradley, the Court cannot instruct the jury on what to believe
about contested evidence. I've proposed neutral alternative language that lets
the jury decide.

Has the Court had an opportunity to review my objections and alternative
language?"

IF JUDGE WANTS TO DEFER TO TRIAL:
"I understand, Your Honor. I'm preserving my Bradley objection on the record.
I'll renew it before instructions are read."

IF JUDGE ASKS PROSECUTOR TO RESPOND:
- Listen carefully
- Note any concessions
- Don't argue back and forth; let the Judge decide

FALLBACK POSITION:
At minimum, get acknowledgment that the Court received your written objections
and will consider them before instructing the jury.

================================================================================
PRIORITY 3: OUTSTANDING DISCOVERY - OFFICER 2 (2-3 minutes)
================================================================================

THE ISSUE:
Officer 2 appears in video for 3.5+ hours, made the arrest, searched vehicle,
handled tow--but is not named in any report and hasn't been identified.

SCRIPT:
"Your Honor, I have an outstanding Brady demand. The video evidence shows a
second officer present for over three and a half hours. The transcript of his
bodycam shows he made statements during the arrest and conducted the vehicle
inventory. Yet he's not identified in any police report.

Mr. Johnson, can you identify this officer today?"

IF STATE IDENTIFIES OFFICER 2:
"Thank you. Has the State produced his bodycam footage?"

IF STATE WON'T OR CAN'T IDENTIFY:
"Your Honor, this officer is captured on video making statements and
participating in the arrest. His identity and any statements he made are
discoverable under Brady. I request the Court order the State to identify
this officer and produce his bodycam footage before trial."

IF NOTHING PRODUCED:
"I'm preserving my right to request an adverse inference instruction at trial--
that the jury may infer his testimony would have been unfavorable to the State."

================================================================================
PRIORITY 4: ENHANCEMENT CLARIFICATION (1-2 minutes)
================================================================================

THE CONFUSION FROM JANUARY 12:
- Defense: "The prior was reckless driving, not DUI."
- Prosecutor: "Impaired. It's the same thing."
- No clarification provided

SCRIPT:
"Your Honor, I'd like to clarify the enhancement issue. On Monday, I noted that
my 2019 conviction was for reckless driving, not DUI. Mr. Johnson stated
'impaired' is 'the same thing.'

Can the State clarify the legal basis for the enhancement? The charging
document references DUI, but my prior was reduced to reckless driving. If
reckless driving qualifies as a predicate offense, I'd like to understand
the statutory basis."

PURPOSE:
- Get on record that prior was reckless driving, not DUI
- Force State to articulate legal theory
- Preserve issue for potential appeal

IF JUDGE DOESN'T WANT TO ADDRESS:
"I understand. I'm preserving my objection to the enhancement and will address
it if there's a conviction."

================================================================================
OPTIONAL: VOIR DIRE (ONLY IF THERE'S TIME)
================================================================================

NOTE: Judge was resistant on Monday. Don't push this hard.

BRIEF REQUEST (if natural opening):
"Your Honor, regarding voir dire--I understand the Court will manage the
timing. I just want to confirm I'll have an opportunity to ask questions
about jurors' ability to evaluate scientific evidence and police testimony."

DO NOT:
- Repeat the 45-minute request
- Cite State v. Perea again
- Argue about the importance of the issues

The Judge heard it Monday. Trust that she remembers.

================================================================================
ITEMS NOT TO RAISE (Already Resolved or Inappropriate)
================================================================================

1. TECHNOLOGY - Approved on January 12 (plug into court computer)
2. TRIAL DATES - Confirmed (January 22-23)
3. VOIR DIRE START TIME - Confirmed (8:30 check-in, 9:00 ready for Judge)
4. COBRA DATA - Don't raise unless discovery issue is opened; less critical
   than Officer 2

================================================================================
CLOSING (10 seconds)
================================================================================

"Thank you, Your Honor. To confirm: trial is January 22nd, I'll arrive early
to set up my equipment, and I'll be prepared with my witnesses and exhibits.
I appreciate the Court's time."

================================================================================
CONTINGENCY PLANS
================================================================================

IF JUDGE LIMITS YOUR TIME:
- Prioritize: (1) Witness confirmation, (2) Jury instructions record,
  (3) Officer 2 identity
- Accept limitations gracefully: "I understand, Your Honor."
- Say: "I'm preserving these issues on the record."

IF TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH WEBEX:
- Have phone number ready: +1-408-418-9388, Access code: 248 425 22469
- Email court immediately: josephcl@utcourts.gov
- Be on 10 minutes early to test connection

IF STATE RAISES NEW ISSUES:
- Ask: "Your Honor, I wasn't aware of this. May I have until 5 PM today to
  respond in writing?"
- Don't agree to anything you don't understand

IF JUDGE SEEMS IMPATIENT:
- Shorten everything
- Focus only on: "I have filed written objections. I'm preserving my record."
- Say: "I don't want to take more of the Court's time. I'll be ready Thursday."
