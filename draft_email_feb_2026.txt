Dear Counsel,

In advance of the February 17, 2026 pretrial conference, I am writing to confirm the following:

1. TRIAL DATE: I understand the trial is set for March 31, 2026, per the stipulated continuance. Please confirm.

2. MOTION TO COMPEL (FILED): I have filed a Motion to Compel Production of Trooper Vincent Carpenter's bodycam footage and records. The Defense has identified Trooper Carpenter as the second UHP officer present during the September 6, 2023 arrest. His signature appears on the Vehicle Impound Report in the State's case file. His bodycam footage, any notes, and any reports he created have not been produced in discovery. I request production no later than March 17, 2026.

3. OUTSTANDING DISCOVERY: The following items remain outstanding:
   - COBRA data (Computerized Online Breath Archives) for the Intoxilyzer 8000 test administered on September 6, 2023
   - Complete Intoxilyzer maintenance and error logs (beyond certification dates)

4. JURY INSTRUCTIONS: The Defense's objections to the State's proposed "affirmative findings" instruction and the Defense's proposed instructions (#6, 7, 8, 10, 11) remain pending from the January filings. I will be requesting a ruling at the February 17 pretrial.

I am available to discuss any of these items before the hearing. I can be reached at (801) 618-7609 or peter.golub@gmail.com.

Respectfully,

Peter Golub
Defendant, Pro Se
