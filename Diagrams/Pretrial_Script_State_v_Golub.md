# Pretrial Conference Script & Strategy Guide

**Case:** State of Utah v. Peter Dmitry Golub, No. 235900706
**Court:** Third District Court, Salt Lake County
**Judge:** Hon. Teresa Hruby-Mills
**Date:** February 17, 2026

---

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive script and strategic guide for the February 17, 2026, pretrial conference. It is designed to be used as a direct reference in court. The script is organized by the six key issues to be addressed, providing the precise legal language, defense arguments, anticipated prosecution responses, and effective rebuttals for each. The primary objective is to secure favorable rulings that strengthen the defense for the March 31, 2026, trial and to meticulously preserve all legal issues for appeal.

### How to Use This Document

Follow the script for each issue in the order presented. This order is strategic, beginning with straightforward logistical matters before moving to more contentious discovery and legal disputes. If the judge alters the order, simply navigate to the relevant section. Use the "Key Legal Language" sections to ensure all arguments are properly grounded in the applicable rules and case law. If any ruling is adverse, conclude the hearing with the **Master Record Preservation Script** at the end of this document.

### Opening Statement to the Court

When your case is called, begin with a clear and concise roadmap for the judge.

> **Your Script:** "Good morning, Your Honor. Peter Golub, defendant, appearing pro se. I have six issues I would like to address for the Court today: first, trial logistics and readiness; second, my pending Motion to Compel regarding the second officer, Trooper Carpenter; third, outstanding Intoxilyzer discovery; fourth, the pending jury instruction disputes; fifth, my request to bifurcate the enhancement allegation; and finally, voir dire and courtroom technology. I will be as efficient as possible."

---

## Issue 1: Trial Logistics & Readiness

### 1.1. Defense Goal

To confirm the March 31, 2026, trial date on the record and establish clear deadlines for all remaining pretrial matters. This demonstrates reasonableness and a focus on an efficient, fair trial, while preventing last-minute delays or surprises from the State.

### 1.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Opening** | "Your Honor, my first item is trial logistics. My understanding is that trial is currently set for March 31, 2026, pursuant to the prior stipulation. I am planning to be ready on that date, subject to the timely resolution of the discovery matters we will discuss today." | "The State is also planning to be ready for trial on March 31st, Your Honor." | (No rebuttal needed if State agrees) |
| **Confirmation** | "I would ask the State to confirm on the record that they anticipate being ready for trial that week. I would also ask the Court to confirm whether it anticipates any scheduling issues, and if a new jury panel will be summoned for that date." | "We have no reason to believe we won't be ready, Your Honor." | (No rebuttal needed) |
| **Deadlines** | "Finally, to ensure a smooth trial, I would ask the Court to set firm deadlines for final witness and exhibit lists, and for any motions in limine." | "The State has no objection to reasonable deadlines, Your Honor." | "I would propose that final witness and exhibit lists be exchanged by March 21st, and any motions in limine be filed by March 24th. That gives both parties and the Court a full week to prepare." |

### 1.3. Key Legal Language

*   This section is primarily procedural. The key is to use clear, non-argumentative language focused on scheduling and readiness.
*   Phrases like "to ensure a smooth and efficient trial," "for the clarity of the record," and "to prevent any last-minute delays" are effective.

## Issue 2: Motion to Compel — Trooper Vincent Carpenter

### 2.1. Defense Goal

To secure a court order compelling the State to produce all records related to the second officer, Trooper Vincent Carpenter, by a firm deadline (March 17, 2026), or to provide a written certification if such records do not exist. This motion is critical for trial preparation, impeachment of the primary officer, and preserving a powerful appellate issue.

### 2.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | "Your Honor, my second item is my Motion to Compel Discovery Regarding Second Officer, filed on February 12th. For over two years, I have asked the State to identify the second officer who was present for my entire arrest. He is visible on body-cam for over three and a half hours, participated in the vehicle search, and signed the impound report. He is not mentioned in any police report or witness list." | "Your Honor, the State has provided all the discovery it has. The primary officer, Corporal Ernstsen, is the only witness the State intends to call regarding the stop." | "Your Honor, the State’s obligation under Rule 16 and *Brady* is not limited to the witnesses it intends to call. It extends to the entire prosecution team, which includes the Utah Highway Patrol. Trooper Carpenter is a material witness whose records are essential for my defense." |
| **The Ask** | "I have now identified him myself. The Vehicle Impound Report, which is Exhibit A to my motion, is signed by Trooper Vincent Carpenter of the Utah Highway Patrol. I am asking the Court to order the State to produce, by March 17th, any reports, notes, CAD logs, and Evidence.com manifests authored by him, or a written certification explaining their absence." | "We don’t have any reports from Trooper Carpenter. If he didn’t write one, we can’t produce it. This is a fishing expedition." | "This is not a fishing expedition; it is a request for basic discovery. If no report exists, that is itself a critical fact for trial. The jury deserves to know that a second officer was intimately involved for hours but created no official record. A written certification of that fact is the appropriate remedy under Rule 16." |
| **Relevance** | "I am not asking to call Trooper Carpenter. I need his records to prepare for cross-examination of Corporal Ernstsen. The omission of a second officer from all official reports raises serious questions about the completeness and accuracy of the investigation. His footage and notes are directly relevant to impeachment and may contain exculpatory evidence." | "The defendant can cross-examine Corporal Ernstsen on his own report. What another officer may or may not have written is irrelevant." | "It is highly relevant, Your Honor. If Trooper Carpenter’s observations contradict Corporal Ernstsen’s, that is classic impeachment material under *Giglio*. If his records are missing, that speaks to the reliability of the entire investigation. I cannot prepare for that cross-examination without knowing what records exist." |

### 2.3. Key Legal Language

*   **Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a):** The prosecutor must disclose evidence "material to the preparation of the defense" and any documents "intended for use by the prosecutor as evidence in chief." This includes police reports and witness statements.
*   ***Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963):** The prosecution has a constitutional duty to disclose all exculpatory evidence to the defense, including evidence that is favorable to the accused, either because it is directly exculpatory or because it can be used for impeachment.
*   ***Giglio v. United States*, 405 U.S. 150 (1972):** The *Brady* disclosure obligation extends to evidence that could be used to impeach the credibility of a government witness, including prior inconsistent statements or information that reflects on the witness’s character for truthfulness.

> **Closing Statement for this Issue:** "Your Honor, the State’s obligation is clear. I request a court order compelling production by March 17th, or a formal certification of non-existence, so I can adequately prepare for trial."

## Issue 3: Outstanding Intoxilyzer Discovery

### 3.1. Defense Goal

To secure a court order compelling the State to produce all outstanding discovery related to the Intoxilyzer 8000, including the COBRA data, full maintenance logs, and the two specific certification reports the State has listed as trial exhibits. The deadline should be early March to allow for analysis and potential motions in limine.

### 3.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | "Your Honor, the third issue is outstanding discovery regarding the Intoxilyzer 8000, serial number 80-003421. The reliability of this instrument is the central issue of the entire case. I am still missing three critical categories of evidence." | "Your Honor, the defense has the test result. That is what the statute requires. We are not obligated to produce the entire life history of the machine." | "Your Honor, the State is obligated to produce all evidence material to the defense. Given the 144-second impossible breath test in this case, the machine’s performance and reliability are not just material; they are the whole case. The simple test slip is insufficient." |
| **The Ask** | "First, I have not received the COBRA data, which is the digital record of the test sequence. Second, I have not received the full maintenance and error logs. Third, the State’s own Exhibit List from April 4, 2025, names two specific certification reports from August and September 2023, which I have never been provided. I am asking the Court to order production of all three items by March 10th." | "The certification reports are just boilerplate showing the machine was working. The defense doesn’t need them. The COBRA data is technical and not easily readable." | "If the State intends to use the certifications as trial exhibits, they must be produced under Rule 16. And whether the COBRA data is technical is irrelevant. It contains the underlying data of the test itself—aborted attempts, flow rates, and error flags. It is precisely what is needed to determine if the machine was functioning properly." |
| **Remedy** | "If these documents are not produced, the State should be precluded from relying on the breath test at trial, or at a minimum, from introducing the certification reports and arguing that the machine is presumptively reliable. This discovery is essential for my ability to confront the evidence against me." | "That’s an extreme remedy. The State should be allowed to proceed with its evidence." | "Your Honor, the remedy is proportional to the violation. If the State withholds the very evidence that would prove or disprove the reliability of its scientific instrument, then the results of that instrument cannot be admitted. At minimum, an adverse inference instruction would be warranted." |

### 3.3. Key Legal Language

*   **Utah Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(4):** Requires the prosecutor to disclose "any reports or statements of experts, made in connection with the particular case, including results of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons." This directly applies to COBRA data and certification reports.
*   **Foundation for Scientific Evidence:** Before scientific evidence can be admitted, the proponent (the State) must lay a foundation demonstrating its reliability. This includes showing the device was functioning correctly. Withholding maintenance logs and error data prevents the defense from meaningfully challenging that foundation.

> **Closing Statement for this Issue:** "Your Honor, the State cannot use a scientific test as its primary evidence of guilt while simultaneously withholding the data that shows how that test was performed. I ask for a production order by March 10th."

## Issue 4: Jury Instructions

### 4.1. Defense Goal

To persuade the judge to reject the State's proposed "affirmative findings" instruction, which would create a presumption that the Intoxilyzer is reliable. The goal is to ensure the jury is instructed that they are the sole judges of the evidence and that the State bears the burden of proving the test's reliability beyond a reasonable doubt.

### 4.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | "Your Honor, the fourth issue concerns the pending jury instruction disputes from the January filings. The central dispute is the State's proposed 'affirmative findings' instruction. This instruction tells the jury that the Court has already made findings about the Intoxilyzer's reliability, which is a contested fact in this case." | "Your Honor, this is a standard instruction. The Intoxilyzer is a state-approved device, and the jury should be instructed that it is presumed to be reliable unless the defense proves otherwise." | "That misstates the law, Your Honor. The State has the burden of proof on every element, including the reliability of its evidence. This instruction unconstitutionally shifts that burden to the defense. It also asks the Court to comment on a contested fact, which is prohibited." |
| **The Law** | "Under *State v. Bradley*, the Court cannot comment on a contested fact. Here, the machine's proper functioning is the most contested fact. The officer admitted the test was done 'improperly,' and the video shows a physiologically impossible 144-second blow. An instruction presuming reliability is in direct conflict with the evidence." | "The defense can argue the facts to the jury. The instruction simply states the legal baseline that the machine is approved for use." | "The instruction does far more than that. It puts the Court's thumb on the scale for the prosecution. My proposed instructions, particularly Nos. 6, 7, and 8, correctly state the law: that the jury is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and that the State must prove the test's reliability beyond a reasonable doubt." |
| **The Ask** | "I am asking the Court to rule now that it will not give the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction and will instead use a neutral instruction consistent with my proposals. If the Court is not prepared to rule today, I ask for a firm date for a final instructions conference before trial." | "We can resolve this at the end of the trial, Your Honor." | "Resolving this now is critical, Your Honor. The final instructions will shape the entire trial—from voir dire questions to opening statements and closing arguments. Both parties need to know the legal framework they will be operating under." |

### 4.3. Key Legal Language

*   ***State v. Bradley*, 578 P.2d 1292 (Utah 1978):** A Utah Supreme Court case holding that a trial judge may not comment on the evidence in a way that resolves a contested issue of fact for the jury. Arguing that the "affirmative findings" instruction does exactly this is the core of the legal argument.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** A bedrock constitutional principle that the accused is presumed innocent and the State has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Burden-shifting instructions are unconstitutional.

> **Closing Statement for this Issue:** "Your Honor, for the reasons stated and as briefed in my January filings, I ask the Court to reject the State's proposed instruction. For the record, I am renewing and preserving my objections to the State's 'affirmative findings' instruction under *State v. Bradley*, and renewing my request for Defense Instructions #6, 7, 8, 10, and 11."

## Issue 5: Enhancement / Bifurcation

### 5.1. Defense Goal

To bifurcate the trial, meaning the jury will first decide guilt on the underlying DUI charge without hearing any evidence of the prior conviction. If, and only if, the jury returns a guilty verdict, the enhancement allegation is addressed in a separate phase. This prevents the jury from being prejudiced by propensity evidence.

### 5.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Ask** | "Your Honor, my fifth item is a request to bifurcate the enhancement allegation. The State seeks a second-offense DUI enhancement based on a prior conviction. Under Rule 404(b), evidence of a prior conviction is inadmissible during the guilt phase to prove propensity. If the jury hears about a prior before deciding guilt, the prejudice is incurable." | "Your Honor, the enhancement is an element of the offense that the State must prove. The jury needs to hear all the evidence." | "The enhancement is a status element, not a behavioral one. It does not make it more or less likely that the defendant was impaired on the night in question. Its only effect is to suggest a propensity to commit the crime, which is precisely what Rule 404(b) is designed to prevent. Bifurcation is the standard and appropriate remedy." |
| **The Remedy** | "I request that the jury decide guilt on the DUI and failure to signal charges first. If, and only if, there is a conviction on the DUI, the Court can then address the enhancement. This protects my right to a fair trial on the current charge." | "A limiting instruction is sufficient to cure any prejudice." | "Your Honor, while a limiting instruction is better than nothing, studies have shown they are often ineffective. The image of a prior conviction is impossible for a juror to ignore. Bifurcation is a cleaner, more effective, and more just solution that prejudices neither party. The State can still prove its enhancement if it first proves the underlying crime." |

### 5.3. Key Legal Language

*   **Utah Rule of Evidence 404(b):** "Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character." This is the rule against propensity evidence.
*   **Prejudice vs. Probative Value (Rule 403):** Even if relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Evidence of a prior conviction is classic prejudicial evidence.

> **Closing Statement for this Issue:** "Your Honor, to ensure a fair trial on the facts of this specific case, I urge the Court to grant bifurcation. If the Court is not inclined to do so, I request a limiting instruction and am preserving my objection under Rule 404(b)."

## Issue 6: Voir Dire & Technology

### 6.1. Defense Goal

To secure adequate time for voir dire (45 minutes) and clear approval to use courtroom technology (PowerPoint) during trial. This is essential for properly seating a fair jury and effectively presenting the defense's complex scientific and evidentiary arguments.

### 6.2. Script & Argument

| Stage | Your Script | Anticipated Prosecution Response | Your Rebuttal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voir Dire Time** | "Your Honor, my final issue is trial logistics. First, I am requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This case involves a 144-second breath test anomaly, an officer with a 24-times-average arrest rate, and complex scientific evidence. I need adequate time to identify and question jurors about their potential biases regarding scientific evidence and officer credibility." | "Your Honor, 30 minutes is standard and should be sufficient." | "With respect, Your Honor, this is not a standard case. The core of my defense requires jurors to engage in critical thinking about machine reliability and confirmation bias. Uncovering biases on these complex topics in 30 minutes is insufficient. 45 minutes will allow for a thorough and efficient voir dire that ultimately saves time by seating a fair jury from the start." |
| **Technology** | "Second, I request permission to use a laptop and projector during trial for PowerPoint presentations. These will be used as demonstrative exhibits during my opening statement and closing argument to illustrate timelines, the scientific impossibility of the breath test, and other evidence already in the record." | "The State has no objection, provided we receive a copy of the slides in advance." | "I am happy to provide the State with a copy of my slides 24 hours before trial. Could the Court clarify the technical setup—whether I should email the file in advance and how to connect my laptop in this courtroom?" |

### 6.3. Key Legal Language

*   This section is primarily about courtroom procedure, governed by the trial judge's discretion. The key is to frame the requests in terms of ensuring a **fair trial** and **efficiently presenting complex evidence**.

> **Closing Statement for this Issue:** "A fair trial requires a fair jury and the ability to present my defense clearly. 45 minutes of voir dire and the use of PowerPoint are essential to achieving both. Thank you, Your Honor."

## Concluding the Hearing

### 7.1. Final Summary for the Judge

After addressing all six issues, provide a very brief summary of your requests.

> **Your Script:** "Your Honor, to summarize, I am asking for: a ruling on the Motion to Compel Trooper Carpenter's records, a March 10th discovery deadline for the Intoxilyzer materials, a ruling on the jury instructions, bifurcation of the enhancement, 45 minutes for voir dire, and approval to use technology at trial. Thank you for your time."

### 7.2. Master Record Preservation Script

If the judge denies or defers ruling on any of your key requests, you **must** make a clear record before the hearing concludes. This is non-negotiable for preserving your appellate rights.

> **Your Script:** "Your Honor, for the clarity of the record, I am formally preserving the following objections and requests: my Motion to Compel production of Trooper Carpenter's records under Rule 16 and *Brady*; my objections to the State's 'affirmative findings' jury instruction under *State v. Bradley*; my request for Defense Instructions #6, 7, 8, 10, and 11; my request for bifurcation of the enhancement under Rule 404(b); and my demand for COBRA data and complete Intoxilyzer maintenance logs. I will renew all of these at trial. Thank you."

## Appendix A: Demeanor & Courtroom Conduct Reminders

The following reminders are critical for a pro se defendant appearing before the Court. Judges evaluate not only the substance of your arguments but also your professionalism and demeanor.

1. **Be professional, respectful, and efficient.** Address the judge as "Your Honor" at all times. Stand when speaking. Sit when the judge or opposing counsel is speaking.
2. **Listen fully before responding.** When the prosecutor speaks, do not interrupt. Take brief notes, then respond calmly and directly.
3. **Thank the Court for each ruling, even adverse ones.** A simple "Thank you, Your Honor" after any ruling demonstrates respect and maturity.
4. **If the judge defers a ruling, preserve the record and move on gracefully.** Do not argue or express frustration. State your preservation language and proceed to the next issue.
5. **Keep answers short and let the judge ask follow-up questions.** Do not over-explain. If the judge wants more detail, the judge will ask.
6. **Do not reference any personal frustrations with the case or the prosecution.** Stay focused on the legal issues.
7. **If the prosecutor suggests you should get a lawyer, do not engage.** It is irrelevant to the pretrial issues. Simply say, "I appreciate the suggestion, Your Honor, but I am exercising my constitutional right to represent myself and I am prepared to proceed."
