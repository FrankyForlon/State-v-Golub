# SIDE A: YOUR RIGHTS & MAGIC PHRASES

---

## IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND - SAY THIS:

> **"Your Honor, I don't fully understand what's happening. I'd like to request a brief recess to ensure I can preserve my constitutional rights and respond appropriately."**

Or shorter:

> **"Your Honor, I need a moment to understand the procedural posture before responding."**

---

## YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

| Right | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Right to Jury Trial** | You have it. Don't waive it. Bench trial = judge decides = bad for you. |
| **Right to Remain Silent** | You don't have to testify. Can't be held against you. |
| **Right to Confront Witnesses** | You can cross-examine anyone who testifies against you. |
| **Right to Present Defense** | You can call witnesses, present evidence, make arguments. |
| **Right to Due Process** | State must follow proper procedures. Object when they don't. |
| **Presumption of Innocence** | You're innocent until proven guilty. State has burden. |
| **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt** | Highest standard. "Probably guilty" isn't enough. |

---

## WHEN TO SAY "OBJECTION"

| Say This | When This Happens |
|----------|-------------------|
| **"Objection, relevance"** | Evidence has nothing to do with the charges |
| **"Objection, hearsay"** | Witness quotes what someone else said (not present) |
| **"Objection, leading"** | Prosecutor asks witness yes/no questions on direct |
| **"Objection, foundation"** | No proof document/evidence is what they say it is |
| **"Objection, speculation"** | Witness guessing, not stating facts |
| **"Objection, asked and answered"** | Same question asked multiple times |
| **"Objection, 404(b)"** | Prior bad acts used to show propensity |

**If objection sustained:** Evidence excluded. Good.
**If objection overruled:** Say "Exception noted" to preserve for appeal.

---

## PRESERVE THE RECORD - CRITICAL

After ANY adverse ruling, say:

> **"Your Honor, I'd like to note my objection for the record."**

Or:

> **"Exception noted, Your Honor."**

This preserves your right to appeal. If you don't object, you waive it.

---

## THE GOLDEN PHRASE (Memorize This)

> **"Your Honor, I don't understand the current procedural posture. I'd like to request a continuance so I can research the options available to me and ensure I preserve my constitutional rights."**

Use this ANY time you're confused. It's not weakness - it's smart.

| Judge won't rule | "I'm preserving this objection for the record." |
| Don't understand | "Your Honor, could you explain the procedural options available to me?" |

**If you need a break:**
> "Your Honor, may we take a brief recess?"

**If you're losing and need to stop:**
> "Your Honor, I move for a mistrial based on [specific prejudicial error]."

**If judge seems biased:**
> "Your Honor, for the record, I'm objecting to [specific ruling] and preserving the issue for appeal."

1. **Stay calm.** Judges respect composure.
2. **Ask if confused.** It's your right.
