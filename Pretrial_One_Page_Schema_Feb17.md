## FOUR PILLARS OF THE DEFENSE (context for every argument)

1. **Scientific Failure** — 144-second breath test (21.6L air vs. 4.8L lung capacity); single sample; no blood draw; officer admitted test was "improper"
2. **No Video of Traffic Violation** — ~10 blocks of footage; no failure-to-signal captured on any camera
3. **Confirmation Bias** — Ernstsen's 24x average DUI arrest rate (GRAMA data); ignored perfect one-leg stand (0/4 clues)
4. **Procedural Violations** — ~80 minutes of custodial questioning before Miranda; missing second officer in all paperwork

---

## IF RULING IS ADVERSE — PRESERVE THE RECORD

> "Your Honor, for the record, I am preserving: (1) my Motion to Compel under Rule 16 and *Brady*; (2) my objections to the 'affirmative findings' instruction under *Bradley*; (3) my request for Defense Instructions 6, 7, 8, 10, 11; (4) my request for bifurcation under Rule 404(b); (5) my demand for COBRA data and Intoxilyzer logs. I will renew all at trial."
