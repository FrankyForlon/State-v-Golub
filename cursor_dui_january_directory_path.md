# STATE v. GOLUB (Case No. 235900706) - CASE SUMMARY

## CHARGES
1. **DUI - 2nd Offense in 10 Years** (Class A Misdemeanor)
2. **Failure to Signal** (Infraction)

**Note:** Prior conviction was for reckless driving, NOT DUI, but State seeks enhancement.

## KEY FACTS
- **Arrest Date:** September 6, 2023
- **Arresting Officer:** Corporal Brock Ernstsen (Utah Highway Patrol)
- **Breath Test Result:** 0.104 g/210L (single sample after 144-second test)
- **Defendant:** Peter Golub (Pro Se)
- **Judge:** Elizabeth A. Hruby-Mills, Third District Court
- **Prosecutor:** Joseph Johnson (5th prosecutor assigned to case)

### Critical Evidence Points:
1. **144-Second Breath Test:** Video shows physiologically impossible 144-second continuous blow (7-9x normal maximum of 12-20 seconds). Officer admitted test was "improperly done."
2. **24x Arrest Rate:** GRAMA data shows Corporal Ernstsen's DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average, indicating potential confirmation bias.
3. **80+ Minutes Without Miranda:** Custody began at minute 5 (ordered out of vehicle), Miranda given at minute 85 (at jail).
4. **Officer 2:** Second officer present for 3.5+ hours but omitted from all reports.
5. **One-Leg Stand:** 0/4 clues of impairment (perfect performance).
6. **Traffic Stop:** Officer positioned 100-125 feet away with obstructed view; followed for 10 blocks with no additional violations.

## PROCEDURAL HISTORY

**December 2024:** Initial motions to suppress filed; evidentiary hearing held December 31, 2024.

**January 2, 2025:** Motions DENIED after Ernstsen testimony; motion cutoff set for February 28, 2025.

**August-October 2025:** Additional motions filed; new prosecutor (5th) substituted October 6, 2025.

**October 29, 2025:** State moved to strike motions as untimely; Defense withdrew motions; Judge refused to hear voir dire/instruction arguments. **All motions FAILED** - case proceeding to jury trial.

**January 9, 2026:** Jury instructions & voir dire due (5 PM).

**January 12, 2026:** FINAL PRETRIAL (1:00 PM, W47).

**January 22-23, 2026:** TRIAL (Voir Dire 8:30 AM Day 1; Trial Day 2 at 9:00 AM).

## MOTIONS FILED AND OUTCOMES

### Motions Filed:
1. **Motion to Suppress Evidence** (December 2024)

   - **OUTCOME: DENIED** (January 2, 2025)

2. **Motion in Limine - Breath Test** (October 2025)
   - Grounds: 144-second test violates R714-500-6, physiologically impossible
   - **OUTCOME: WITHDRAWN** (October 29, 2025 - deemed untimely)

3. **Motion in Limine - Statements** (October 2025)
   - Grounds: 80+ minutes without Miranda warnings

# PRETRIAL PLAN FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 2026 (1:00 PM)

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. JURY INSTRUCTION DISPUTES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**State's Problematic Instruction (Page 29):**
"The Court has made the following affirmative findings concerning the Intoxilyzer machine... the affidavit establishes a rebuttable presumption that the Intoxilyzer machine was functioning properly."

**Defense Objection:**
- This constitutes impermissible judicial comment on contested evidence
- Violates State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292 (Utah 1978) - prohibits judicial comment on contested facts
- Invades jury's province to determine facts
- Officer admitted test was "improperly done" - contradicts "affirmative findings"

**Requested Relief:**
- Strike "affirmative findings" language
- Replace with: "The jury shall determine from the evidence whether the device was functioning properly"
- Adopt Defense Instructions #6 (Confirmation Bias), #7-8 (FST/Breath Test Protocols), #10 (Initial Stop)

**Script for Arguing Against "Affirmative Findings" Instruction:**

"Your Honor, the State's proposed instruction on page 29 tells the jury that this Court has made 'affirmative findings' about the Intoxilyzer. That's reversible error under State v. Bradley. 

The officer himself testified that the test was improperly done. The video shows a 144-second blow - a physiological impossibility. Whether the machine was functioning properly is a contested fact question for the jury, not a judicial finding.

The State's instruction invades the jury's province and tells them what to believe about contested evidence. We request the Court strike that language and use our proposed alternative that properly leaves the question to the jury."

### 2. VOIR DIRE TIME REQUEST

**Request: 45 minutes minimum**

**Justification:**
- Officer has extraordinary arrest pattern (24x average) that jury needs to understand
- Need to explore juror attitudes about:
  - Police credibility and confirmation bias
  - Scientific evidence reliability
  - Burden of proof understanding
  - DUI enforcement patterns

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This officer has an extraordinary arrest pattern - 24 times the state average - that raises questions about confirmation bias under State v. Perea. The jury needs adequate time to understand these issues and for us to identify jurors who can fairly evaluate this evidence."

### 3. TECHNOLOGY/POWERPOINT APPROVAL REQUEST

**Request:** Permission to use PowerPoint presentation during trial

**Purpose:**
- Display video timestamps showing 144-second breath test
- Show side-by-side comparisons of officer testimony vs. video evidence
- Present scientific data on breath test protocols
- Display timeline of Miranda violations
- Visual aids for jury instruction arguments

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting permission to use PowerPoint during trial to present video evidence, timelines, and scientific data. This will help the jury understand complex technical issues like the 144-second breath test anomaly and the Miranda timeline."

### 4. OFFICER 2 IDENTIFICATION ISSUE

**Problem:** Second officer present for 3.5+ hours during arrest, search, and transport but:
- Omitted from all police reports
- Not identified in State's witness list
- Not disclosed in discovery
- Visible in dashcam and bodycam video

**Request:**
- State must identify Officer 2
- State must produce Officer 2's bodycam footage
- State must explain omission from reports
- If State calls Officer 2, Defense needs notice

**Script:**
"Your Honor, the videos show a second officer was present for over three hours - he arrested Mr. Golub, searched the vehicle, and handled the tow. Yet he's not in any report, not on the witness list, and we don't even know his name. This is a Brady/Giglio issue. We need his identity, his bodycam, and an explanation for why he was omitted from all documentation."

### 5. DISCOVERY COMPLETENESS

**Outstanding Items:**
- COBRA data (Computerized Online Breath Archives) for Intoxilyzer 8000
- Complete maintenance/calibration records for the specific machine used
- Officer 2's complete personnel file and bodycam footage
- Any Brady/Giglio material regarding Ernstsen's arrest patterns

**Script:**
"Your Honor, we're still missing critical discovery: the COBRA data that would show the flow rate during the 144-second test, Officer 2's bodycam, and complete maintenance records. We need these before trial to properly prepare our defense."

### 6. EXHIBIT STIPULATIONS

**Request Stipulations:**
- Video timestamps showing 144-second breath test
- Officer's admission that test was "improperly done"
- GRAMA data showing 24x arrest rate
- Miranda timeline (custody at minute 5, warnings at minute 85)

**Script:**
"Your Honor, to save trial time, we'd like to stipulate to certain facts: the video shows a 144-second test, the officer admitted it was improperly done, and the Miranda timeline. Can we get the State's agreement on these?"

### 7. WITNESS LIST CONFIRMATION

**Confirm:**
- State's witness list (currently only Ernstsen listed)
- Whether State will call Officer 2
- Whether State will call any expert witnesses
- Defense witness list (if any)

### 8. TRIAL LOGISTICS

**Confirm:**
- Trial dates: January 22-23, 2026
- Voir dire start time: 8:30 AM Day 1
- Expected trial length: 2 days
- Exhibit numbering system
- Video playback equipment availability

## BACKUP ARGUMENTS IF JUDGE RESISTS

**If Judge Won't Hear Jury Instruction Arguments:**
- File written objections before trial
- Make record: "Your Honor, I'm making a record that I've raised these objections. If the State's instruction is given, this is reversible error under State v. Bradley."
- Request sidebar during trial when instruction is read

**If Judge Limits Voir Dire Time:**
- Prioritize questions about police credibility and scientific evidence
- Request additional time if needed during voir dire
- Make record of time limitation

**If State Won't Identify Officer 2:**
- Request adverse inference instruction
- Request continuance if Officer 2 is called at trial
- File motion to compel if necessary

## SUCCESS METRICS FOR PRETRIAL

**Minimum Acceptable Outcomes:**
1. Judge agrees to hear jury instruction arguments
2. Voir dire time allocated (even if less than 45 minutes)
3. Officer 2 identification or explanation for omission
4. Technology approval for PowerPoint
5. Discovery completeness confirmed or timeline set

**Ideal Outcomes:**
1. "Affirmative findings" language stricken
2. Defense jury instructions adopted
3. Full 45 minutes voir dire
4. Officer 2 identified and bodycam produced
5. All discovery complete
6. Stipulations on key facts

# DEFENSE THEORY SUMMARY - STATE v. GOLUB

## THE THREE PILLARS OF DEFENSE

### PILLAR 1: THE 144-SECOND BREATH TEST ANOMALY

**The Core Argument:**
The Intoxilyzer 8000 test recorded a 144-second continuous breath sample - a physiological impossibility that proves the test was invalid, the machine malfunctioned, or the protocol was manipulated.

**Key Evidence:**
- **Video Evidence:** Bodycam shows continuous 144-second "blow" (7-9x normal maximum of 12-20 seconds)
- **Physiological Impossibility:** Human vital capacity is ~4.8 liters. A 144-second blow at minimum flow rate (0.15 L/s) requires 21.6 liters - 4.5x human capacity
- **Officer's Admission:** Ernstsen testified: "The defendant would not properly blow into the machine, so we had to make several attempts" (Dec 31, 2024 hearing)
- **Single Sample:** R714-500-6(E) requires two samples agreeing within 0.020 g/210L - only one sample taken
- **No Reset/Retest:** Officer failed to reset machine or conduct blood draw when anomaly occurred
- **Result:** 0.104 g/210L from corrupted single sample

**Legal Authority:**
- **Utah Admin. Code R714-500-6(A)(3):** "Breath specimen analyzed shall be essentially alveolar or end expiratory in composition"
  - A 144-second sample cannot be "essentially alveolar" - it exceeds biological limits by 400%+
- **Intoxilyzer 8000 Manual:** Standard test is 4-6 seconds, maximum ~20 seconds
- **Case Law:** State v. Schmidt (Ohio 2015), State v. Swindle (Fla. 2015) - courts have suppressed Intoxilyzer results for procedural violations

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "The machine produced a number, that's all that matters"
  - **Counter:** The number is meaningless if the test violated scientific protocols. A thermometer reading taken in an oven isn't valid either.
- State will argue: "The defendant was uncooperative"
  - **Counter:** Even if true, uncooperation doesn't make a 144-second blow physiologically possible. The officer should have recognized machine failure and drawn blood.
- State will argue: "The code doesn't specify a maximum time"
  - **Counter:** The "essentially alveolar" requirement incorporates biological limits. Expert testimony will establish 12-20 seconds as the physiological maximum.

---

### PILLAR 2: 24X ARREST RATE BIAS (CONFIRMATION BIAS)

**The Core Argument:**
Corporal Ernstsen's DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average, demonstrating confirmation bias under State v. Perea. This bias explains why he ignored the impossible 144-second test and failed to follow proper procedures.

**Key Evidence:**
- **GRAMA Data:** Ernstsen's stop-to-arrest ratio is 24x state average
- **Pattern of Behavior:** Officer "very familiar with the location of nearly every bar" and patrols "areas with bars and nightclubs" (KSL article)
- **Tunnel Vision:** Officer ignored physiological impossibility of 144-second blow, failed to reset machine, failed to draw blood
- **Omission of Officer 2:** Failed to document second officer's 3.5-hour involvement - suggests pattern of incomplete/inaccurate reporting
- **Selective Documentation:** Documented 6/6 HGN clues (subjective, unverifiable) but 0/4 One-Leg Stand clues (objective, verifiable on video)

**Legal Authority:**
- **State v. Perea, 2013 UT 68:** Utah Supreme Court acknowledged confirmation bias as real psychological phenomenon affecting police investigations
- **Application:** Officer's 24x arrest rate + failure to recognize 144-second impossibility = tunnel vision bias
- **Jury Instruction Needed:** Defense Instruction #6 on confirmation bias and evaluating officer credibility

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "High arrest rate shows he's good at his job"
  - **Counter:** A 24x average suggests targeting, not skill. If he were that good, his cases wouldn't have acquittals and dismissals.
- State will argue: "Past cases are irrelevant"
  - **Counter:** Pattern of behavior is relevant to credibility and bias. The 24x rate explains why he ignored the impossible test result.
- State will argue: "This is character assassination"
  - **Counter:** This is about credibility and bias, not character. The evidence shows a pattern that explains his actions in this case.

---

### PILLAR 3: 80+ MINUTES WITHOUT MIRANDA

**The Core Argument:**
Mr. Golub was in custody from minute 5 (ordered out of vehicle) but Miranda warnings were not given until minute 85 (at jail). This 80-minute period of unwarned custodial interrogation violates the Fifth Amendment.

**Key Evidence:**
- **Timeline:**
  - Minute 0: Traffic stop
  - Minute 5: Ordered out of vehicle (custody begins under Berkemer v. McCarty)
  - Minute 28: Handcuffed
  - Minute 85: Miranda warnings given at jail
- **Custodial Interrogation:** Officer asked questions about drinking, where coming from, etc. during unwarned period
- **Video Evidence:** Bodycam/dashcam show timeline clearly
- **Legal Standard:** Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984) - traffic stop can become custody

**Legal Authority:**
- **Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420 (1984):** Traffic stop becomes custody when reasonable person would not feel free to leave
- **State v. Mirquet, 914 P.2d 1144 (Utah 1996):** FSTs can constitute custody
- **Application:** Once ordered out and handcuffed, custody clearly established

**Weaknesses to Address:**
- State will argue: "Traffic stops aren't custody"
  - **Counter:** True initially, but once ordered out and handcuffed, custody clearly established. Berkemer recognizes this distinction.
- State will argue: "No interrogation occurred"
  - **Counter:** Questions about drinking, where coming from, etc. constitute interrogation. Video shows this clearly.
- State will argue: "Statements were voluntary"
  - **Counter:** Even if voluntary, Miranda still required once custody established. The violation is procedural, not about voluntariness.

---

## INTEGRATED DEFENSE THEORY

**The Narrative:**
An officer with 24 times the normal arrest rate stopped Mr. Golub based on a questionable traffic violation. Predetermined to find guilt, the officer ignored an impossible 144-second breath test result, failed to follow proper procedures (no reset, no blood draw), and violated Miranda rights. The only physical evidence - a single corrupted breath test - is unreliable because it violated scientific protocols.

**How the Pillars Support Each Other:**
1. **Pillar 1 (144-second test)** shows the officer ignored scientific impossibility
2. **Pillar 2 (24x arrest rate)** explains WHY he ignored it (confirmation bias)
3. **Pillar 3 (Miranda violation)** shows pattern of procedural disregard

**The Closing:**
"When a DUI Task Force officer with 24 times the average arrest rate forces a physiologically impossible 144-second breath test, admits it wasn't properly done, then fails to draw blood or reset the machine - that's not good police work. That's confirmation bias. And when you add 80 minutes without Miranda, you have a case built on unreliable evidence obtained through improper procedures. The State cannot prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt when their only physical evidence comes from a broken process."

---

## KEY EVIDENCE SUPPORTING EACH PILLAR

### Supporting Pillar 1:
- Video of 144-second test
- Intoxilyzer printout showing 2.039L volume after 144 seconds
- Officer's admission of improper administration
- Scientific literature on breath test protocols
- Utah Admin. Code R714-500-6

### Supporting Pillar 2:
- GRAMA data on arrest statistics
- KSL article about officer's enforcement patterns
- Omission of Officer 2 from reports
- Selective documentation of FST results
- State v. Perea case law

### Supporting Pillar 3:
- Video timeline showing custody at minute 5
- Video showing Miranda at minute 85
- Transcripts of unwarned questioning
- Berkemer v. McCarty case law

---

## WEAKNESSES TO ADDRESS

### Overall Weaknesses:
1. **No Expert Witness:** Defense cannot afford expert to testify about breath test science
   - **Mitigation:** Use scientific literature, manuals, and case law. Cross-examine officer on his lack of scientific training.

2. **Prior Conviction:** State will try to use 2019 reckless driving conviction
   - **Mitigation:** Argue it's not a DUI conviction, request bifurcated trial, emphasize it's propensity evidence

3. **BAC Result:** 0.104 is above legal limit
   - **Mitigation:** Attack the reliability of the test itself. If the test was invalid, the number is meaningless.

4. **Officer's Experience:** State will emphasize Ernstsen's training and experience
   - **Mitigation:** Use his experience against him - an experienced officer should have recognized the 144-second impossibility.

5. **Video Shows Some Indicators:** State will point to any signs of impairment on video
   - **Mitigation:** Emphasize perfect One-Leg Stand (0/4 clues), normal driving for 10 blocks, fatigue as alternative explanation.

### Specific Weaknesses by Pillar:

**Pillar 1 Weaknesses:**
- State may argue defendant was "pumping" air (inhaling/exhaling repeatedly)
  - **Counter:** That would violate "continuous sample" requirement and contaminate the sample
- State may produce maintenance records showing machine was calibrated
  - **Counter:** Calibration doesn't fix a 144-second anomaly. The test itself violated protocols.

**Pillar 2 Weaknesses:**
- Judge may limit evidence of past cases
  - **Counter:** Focus on the 24x statistic and how it explains current case behavior
- State will argue this is character assassination
  - **Counter:** This is about credibility and bias, not character. Pattern explains actions.

**Pillar 3 Weaknesses:**
- Statements may not be particularly incriminating
  - **Counter:** Still a Miranda violation. Even if statements aren't used, shows pattern of procedural disregard.

1. ⚠️ BAC result 0.104 (above legal limit)
2. ⚠️ Machine certification records
3. ⚠️ Prior conviction (if admitted)
4. ⚠️ Officer's subjective observations (odor, bloodshot eyes, etc.)
5. ⚠️ HGN test showing 6/6 clues (if admitted)

### Evidence That Can Go Either Way:
1. ⚠️ Officer 2 testimony (if identified and called)
2. ⚠️ Defendant's statements (if admitted despite Miranda)
3. ⚠️ Field sobriety test results (improperly administered but some clues noted)

## PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR PRETRIAL

### Must Obtain:
1. **COBRA Data** - Motion to compel if State won't produce
2. **Officer 2 Identity** - Demand at pretrial, Brady argument
3. **Officer 2 Bodycam** - Essential for impeachment
4. **Complete Maintenance Records** - May show machine issues

### Should Obtain:
1. **Character Witness List** - Identify and prepare
2. **Stipulations** - Get State to agree on key facts (144-second test, Miranda timeline)
3. **Expert Affidavits** - If cannot afford live expert, use affidavits from literature authors

### Prepare for Trial:
1. **Video Clips** - Edit key moments (144-second test, One-Leg Stand, Miranda timing)
2. **Timeline Charts** - Visual aids for jury
3. **Scientific Literature Binders** - Organized for cross-examination
4. **Transcript References** - Quick access to officer's admissions

## EVIDENCE PRESENTATION ORDER (TRIAL STRATEGY)

### Defense Case Order:
1. **Video Evidence** - Show 144-second test, One-Leg Stand, normal driving
2. **Scientific Literature** - Establish protocols, show violations
3. **GRAMA Data** - Show 24x arrest rate (if admitted)
4. **Officer Cross-Examination** - Use admissions, contradictions
5. **Character Witnesses** (if available) - Humanize defendant
6. **Defendant Testimony** (if called) - Explain fatigue, challenge State's narrative

### Key Evidence to Emphasize:
1. **144-Second Test** - Physiologically impossible
2. **Officer's Admission** - "improperly done"
3. **One-Leg Stand** - 0/4 clues (perfect performance)
4. **Miranda Timeline** - 80 minutes unwarned
5. **Normal Driving** - 10 blocks, no violations
6. **Obstructed View** - Officer couldn't see alleged violation

Created four documents:

1. **1_CASE_SUMMARY.md** — Case overview
2. **2_PRETRIAL_PLAN_JAN_12.md** — Pretrial plan with scripts
3. **3_DEFENSE_THEORY_SUMMARY.md** — Defense theory and three pillars
4. **4_EVIDENCE_INVENTORY.md** — Evidence inventory

## Summary of findings

### Strengths
- 144-second breath test is a strong issue (physiologically impossible)
- Officer admitted the test was "improperly done"
- One-Leg Stand: 0/4 clues (perfect performance)
- 24x arrest rate supports confirmation bias
- 80+ minutes without Miranda is a clear violation
- Video evidence supports the defense

### Critical issues for pretrial
1. State's "affirmative findings" jury instruction — reversible error
2. Officer 2 identification — Brady/Giglio issue
3. COBRA data — missing flow rate data
4. Voir dire time — need 45 minutes minimum

## Additional documents needed

1. State's proposed jury instructions (full text) — to prepare specific objections
2. COBRA data printout — flow rate data for the 144-second test
3. Officer 2's bodycam footage — if available
4. Complete Intoxilyzer maintenance logs — beyond certification dates
5. State's witness list (final) — confirm if Officer 2 will be called
6. Any expert reports the State plans to introduce

## Questions before building trial PowerPoint

1. Visual priorities: Which should be emphasized?
   - 144-second test timeline/animation
   - Side-by-side officer testimony vs. video
   - Miranda timeline
   - Arrest rate statistics visualization
   - All of the above

2. Technology constraints: What equipment will be available in court?
   - Screen/projector size
   - Can you control the presentation, or does the court handle it?

3. PowerPoint structure: Preferred format?
   - Opening statement slides
   - Cross-examination exhibits
   - Closing argument visuals
   - All phases

4. Video clips: Do you have edited clips ready, or should the PowerPoint reference timestamps for playback?

5. Scientific data: How technical should the breath test slides be?
   - Simple visuals for the jury
   - Detailed scientific charts
   - Both (simple with backup detail)

6. Timeline: When do you need the PowerPoint completed?

The documents are ready for review. After you answer these questions, I can build the trial PowerPoint presentation.
