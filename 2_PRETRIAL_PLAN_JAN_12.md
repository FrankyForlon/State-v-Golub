# PRETRIAL PLAN FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 2026 (1:00 PM)

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. JURY INSTRUCTION DISPUTES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**State's Problematic Instruction (Page 29):**
"The Court has made the following affirmative findings concerning the Intoxilyzer machine... the affidavit establishes a rebuttable presumption that the Intoxilyzer machine was functioning properly."

**Defense Objection:**
- This constitutes impermissible judicial comment on contested evidence
- Violates State v. Bradley, 578 P.2d 1292 (Utah 1978) - prohibits judicial comment on contested facts
- Invades jury's province to determine facts
- Officer admitted test was "improperly done" - contradicts "affirmative findings"

**Requested Relief:**
- Strike "affirmative findings" language
- Replace with: "The jury shall determine from the evidence whether the device was functioning properly"
- Adopt Defense Instructions #6 (Confirmation Bias), #7-8 (FST/Breath Test Protocols), #10 (Initial Stop)

**Script for Arguing Against "Affirmative Findings" Instruction:**

"Your Honor, the State's proposed instruction on page 29 tells the jury that this Court has made 'affirmative findings' about the Intoxilyzer. That's reversible error under State v. Bradley. 

The officer himself testified that the test was improperly done. The video shows a 144-second blow - a physiological impossibility. Whether the machine was functioning properly is a contested fact question for the jury, not a judicial finding.

The State's instruction invades the jury's province and tells them what to believe about contested evidence. We request the Court strike that language and use our proposed alternative that properly leaves the question to the jury."

### 2. VOIR DIRE TIME REQUEST

**Request: 45 minutes minimum**

**Justification:**
- Officer has extraordinary arrest pattern (24x average) that jury needs to understand
- Need to explore juror attitudes about:
  - Police credibility and confirmation bias
  - Scientific evidence reliability
  - Burden of proof understanding
  - DUI enforcement patterns

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting 45 minutes for voir dire. This officer has an extraordinary arrest pattern - 24 times the state average - that raises questions about confirmation bias under State v. Perea. The jury needs adequate time to understand these issues and for us to identify jurors who can fairly evaluate this evidence."

### 3. TECHNOLOGY/POWERPOINT APPROVAL REQUEST

**Request:** Permission to use PowerPoint presentation during trial

**Purpose:**
- Display video timestamps showing 144-second breath test
- Show side-by-side comparisons of officer testimony vs. video evidence
- Present scientific data on breath test protocols
- Display timeline of Miranda violations
- Visual aids for jury instruction arguments

**Script:**
"Your Honor, I'm requesting permission to use PowerPoint during trial to present video evidence, timelines, and scientific data. This will help the jury understand complex technical issues like the 144-second breath test anomaly and the Miranda timeline."

### 4. OFFICER 2 IDENTIFICATION ISSUE

**Problem:** Second officer present for 3.5+ hours during arrest, search, and transport but:
- Omitted from all police reports
- Not identified in State's witness list
- Not disclosed in discovery
- Visible in dashcam and bodycam video

**Request:**
- State must identify Officer 2
- State must produce Officer 2's bodycam footage
- State must explain omission from reports
- If State calls Officer 2, Defense needs notice

**Script:**
"Your Honor, the videos show a second officer was present for over three hours - he arrested Mr. Golub, searched the vehicle, and handled the tow. Yet he's not in any report, not on the witness list, and we don't even know his name. This is a Brady/Giglio issue. We need his identity, his bodycam, and an explanation for why he was omitted from all documentation."

### 5. DISCOVERY COMPLETENESS

**Outstanding Items:**
- COBRA data (Computerized Online Breath Archives) for Intoxilyzer 8000
- Complete maintenance/calibration records for the specific machine used
- Officer 2's complete personnel file and bodycam footage
- Any Brady/Giglio material regarding Ernstsen's arrest patterns

**Script:**
"Your Honor, we're still missing critical discovery: the COBRA data that would show the flow rate during the 144-second test, Officer 2's bodycam, and complete maintenance records. We need these before trial to properly prepare our defense."

### 6. EXHIBIT STIPULATIONS

**Request Stipulations:**
- Video timestamps showing 144-second breath test
- Officer's admission that test was "improperly done"
- GRAMA data showing 24x arrest rate
- Miranda timeline (custody at minute 5, warnings at minute 85)

**Script:**
"Your Honor, to save trial time, we'd like to stipulate to certain facts: the video shows a 144-second test, the officer admitted it was improperly done, and the Miranda timeline. Can we get the State's agreement on these?"

### 7. WITNESS LIST CONFIRMATION

**Confirm:**
- State's witness list (currently only Ernstsen listed)
- Whether State will call Officer 2
- Whether State will call any expert witnesses
- Defense witness list (if any)

### 8. TRIAL LOGISTICS

**Confirm:**
- Trial dates: January 22-23, 2026
- Voir dire start time: 8:30 AM Day 1
- Expected trial length: 2 days
- Exhibit numbering system
- Video playback equipment availability

## BACKUP ARGUMENTS IF JUDGE RESISTS

**If Judge Won't Hear Jury Instruction Arguments:**
- File written objections before trial
- Make record: "Your Honor, I'm making a record that I've raised these objections. If the State's instruction is given, this is reversible error under State v. Bradley."
- Request sidebar during trial when instruction is read

**If Judge Limits Voir Dire Time:**
- Prioritize questions about police credibility and scientific evidence
- Request additional time if needed during voir dire
- Make record of time limitation

**If State Won't Identify Officer 2:**
- Request adverse inference instruction
- Request continuance if Officer 2 is called at trial
- File motion to compel if necessary

## SUCCESS METRICS FOR PRETRIAL

**Minimum Acceptable Outcomes:**
1. Judge agrees to hear jury instruction arguments
2. Voir dire time allocated (even if less than 45 minutes)
3. Officer 2 identification or explanation for omission
4. Technology approval for PowerPoint
5. Discovery completeness confirmed or timeline set

**Ideal Outcomes:**
1. "Affirmative findings" language stricken
2. Defense jury instructions adopted
3. Full 45 minutes voir dire
4. Officer 2 identified and bodycam produced
5. All discovery complete
6. Stipulations on key facts
