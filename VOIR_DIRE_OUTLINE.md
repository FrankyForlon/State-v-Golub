# VOIR DIRE OUTLINE — State v. Golub
## March 31, 2026 | Judge Hruby-Mills | 45 minutes requested (30 min minimum)

---

## GOAL

Identify and strike jurors who:
- Automatically credit police testimony over civilian testimony
- Believe breath test machines are infallible
- Cannot hold the State to "beyond a reasonable doubt" when a BAC number exists
- Have personal DUI experiences that make them unable to be fair

Identify and KEEP jurors who:
- Think critically about scientific evidence
- Understand that machines can malfunction
- Believe police should follow procedures
- Can separate "charged" from "guilty"

---

## PHASE 1: INTRODUCTION AND RAPPORT (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Good morning. My name is Peter Golub. I'm representing myself in this case, which I know is unusual. I want to be upfront about that — I'm not a lawyer. But I know the facts of my case better than anyone, and the law gives me the right to be here.

Before we get started, I want you to know: there are no wrong answers. This is the one time in this process where I'm genuinely asking for your honest opinions. If you have a strong feeling about something — even if you think it's not what I want to hear — I need to know. Honesty helps both sides pick a fair jury.

I only have a few topics I need to cover."

---

## PHASE 2: BURDEN OF PROOF / PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE (7 minutes)

**Purpose:** Identify jurors who will actually hold the State to its burden — especially when a BAC number is in evidence.

### Question Block 2A: What "Reasonable Doubt" Means

"Let me ask the group: if you heard that someone was *charged* with a crime, does that make you think they probably did something wrong?"

*(Hands. Follow up with anyone who says yes — explore, don't argue.)*

"The judge will instruct you that being charged means nothing. The State has the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt. That's the highest standard in our legal system.

Here's how I think about it: Imagine I told you a thermometer said your oven was at 4,000 degrees. You can see the number. But do you believe it? Or do you think something went wrong with the thermometer?

That's what this case is about. The State has a number. The question is whether the machine that produced that number was working properly. Can everyone here commit to evaluating the *reliability* of the evidence, not just the number itself?"

*(Listen for hesitation. Note anyone who seems locked onto "a number is a number.")*

### Question Block 2B: Not Guilty ≠ Innocent

"One more thing about the burden. If you vote 'not guilty,' that doesn't mean you're saying someone is innocent. It means the State didn't prove its case. Is anyone here uncomfortable with the idea of voting not guilty, even if you think the person *might* have done it, if the State didn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt?"

*(This is the key question. Anyone who can't separate "probably" from "proven" is a strike.)*

---

## PHASE 3: POLICE CREDIBILITY (8 minutes)

**Purpose:** Find jurors who will weigh officer testimony like any other witness — and identify those who won't.

### Question Block 3A: Officer Testimony

"The judge will instruct you that you may not give *more or less* weight to an officer's testimony just because they're a police officer. They're witnesses like anyone else. Can everyone here follow that instruction?"

*(Watch for body language even if everyone says yes.)*

"Let me put it differently. If a police officer says one thing, and a video shows something different — which do you believe?"

*(This is your real question. The answer should be "the video.")*

### Question Block 3B: Following Procedures

"This case involves questions about whether police procedures were followed. Is there anyone here who feels that even if an officer cuts a few corners, it doesn't really matter as long as they got the right result?"

*(Anyone who says "yes" or signals agreement is a strike. You need jurors who believe procedure matters.)*

### Question Block 3C: High-Volume Officers

"Without getting into the specific facts of the case, let me ask a general question. If you learned that a particular officer made far more arrests for a certain type of crime than other officers — 10 times, 20 times more — what would that tell you? Would you see that as a sign of a hardworking officer, or would it make you wonder whether something else was going on?"

*(You're seeding the confirmation bias argument. Listen for jurors who immediately say "hardworking" — those are State jurors. Jurors who say "I'd want to know more" or "that seems like a lot" are defense jurors.)*

---

## PHASE 4: SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND MACHINES (8 minutes)

**Purpose:** Find jurors who understand that machines can malfunction and that a number is only as reliable as the process that produced it.

### Question Block 4A: Machine Reliability

"Has anyone here ever had an experience where a machine or a test gave a result that was clearly wrong? A medical test, a scale, a thermometer, a computer — anything?"

*(Hands. Let them tell stories. This is gold — they're pre-arguing your case for you. Every story about a wrong medical test or a broken scale builds your narrative.)*

"So we all agree machines can be wrong. The question in this case is: when a machine produces a result that seems scientifically impossible, should the jury just accept the number, or should the jury ask whether something went wrong with the machine?"

### Question Block 4B: The 144-Second Question (Indirect)

"Let me ask it this way, without getting into the specific evidence. If I told you a machine recorded a person doing something that is physically impossible for any human being to do — something that violates basic biology — would that make you question the machine's result?"

*(If anyone says "no, the machine is the machine" — explore that. They may be a strike.)*

### Question Block 4C: Single vs. Multiple Tests

"In science, when you want to be sure of a result, how many times do you test? Is one test enough?"

*(Let them answer. Most will say "more than once." This sets up the single-sample argument.)*

---

## PHASE 5: DUI-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS (7 minutes)

**Purpose:** Surface personal experiences with DUI that could create bias in either direction.

### Question Block 5A: Personal Experience

"Has anyone here, or anyone close to you, ever been affected by drunk driving — either as a victim or as someone who was charged?"

*(This is sensitive. Be respectful. Note anyone with strong emotional connections — they may be unable to be impartial regardless of what they say.)*

### Question Block 5B: Prior Jury Service on DUI

"Has anyone here served on a jury for a DUI case before?"

*(From the January questionnaire data, several jurors had prior DUI jury service. If the March panel has similar jurors, explore whether they can approach this case fresh.)*

"If you've served on a DUI case before, can you commit to judging this case on *this* evidence alone, even if the last case came out a certain way?"

### Question Block 5C: The "Everyone Knows" Problem

"Is there anyone here who feels that if someone is charged with DUI and there's a breath test number above the legal limit, the case is basically over?"

*(Direct. Anyone who says yes is telling you they can't follow the jury instructions about evaluating the test's reliability. Strike.)*

---

## PHASE 6: PRO SE DEFENDANT (3 minutes)

**Purpose:** Address the elephant in the room.

"I mentioned at the start that I'm representing myself. Does that affect how any of you view my case? Does it make you think I'm not taking this seriously? Or that I must be difficult to work with? Or that if I had a real case, I'd have a lawyer?"

*(Let them answer honestly. The ones who say "it doesn't matter" are probably fine. The ones who say "I'd wonder why you don't have a lawyer" — explore whether they can set that aside.)*

"I chose to represent myself because I know the facts of my case. The law allows me to do that. Can everyone here judge this case on the evidence, not on whether I have a law degree?"

---

## PHASE 7: FINAL COMMITMENT (4 minutes)

**Script:**

"I have three final questions for the whole panel.

**First:** Can you promise that if the State does not prove every element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, you will vote not guilty — even if you have a feeling or a suspicion?

**Second:** Can you promise that you will evaluate the reliability of the scientific evidence — not just accept a number because a machine produced it?

**Third:** Can you promise that you will hold the State to the same standard you'd want if you were the one sitting where I am?"

*(Pause after each. Watch for anyone who doesn't nod or looks uncomfortable. Those jurors need follow-up or a challenge.)*

## JUROR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### Ideal Defense Juror Profile
- Thinks critically about authority and institutions
- Has had a personal experience where a machine/test was wrong
- Works in a field that values data quality (science, engineering, QA, healthcare)
- Reads diverse news sources or is skeptical of media
- Has had a negative experience with law enforcement (or knows someone who has)
- Can articulate the difference between "charged" and "guilty"
- Understands that procedures exist for a reason

### Definite Strikes (Challenge for Cause or Peremptory)
- Cannot follow instruction to weigh officer testimony equally
- Cannot follow instruction on presumption of innocence
- Says a BAC number above the limit means guilty
- Close friends/family in law enforcement (especially UHP)
- Prior DUI jury service that resulted in conviction AND they can't separate this case
- Says "if an officer arrests someone, they probably did something wrong"
- Has strong personal DUI victim experience that prevents impartiality

### Watch Carefully (Could Go Either Way)
- Prior DUI jury service (depends on their experience)
- Medical/healthcare workers (understand science but may defer to "official" results)
- Legal background (may understand procedure but may also be skeptical of pro se)
- 12-step program connection (may have strong feelings about alcohol)
- Retired law enforcement friends/family (depends on the relationship)

## CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE — SCRIPTS

If a juror admits they cannot follow an instruction, move to strike for cause:

"Your Honor, Juror [#] has indicated they [cannot follow the instruction on X / would give more weight to officer testimony / cannot presume innocence]. The Defense moves to strike Juror [#] for cause."

If the judge denies a for-cause strike, note it:

"Your Honor, I'm noting my objection for the record and will exercise a peremptory challenge on Juror [#]."

---

## PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE STRATEGY

**Priority order for peremptory challenges:**
1. Jurors who SAY they can be fair but whose body language, occupation, or questionnaire answers suggest otherwise
2. Close connections to law enforcement
3. Prior DUI conviction jurors
4. "Favor the prosecutor" on questionnaire
5. Jurors who seem rigid, rule-following, low-empathy

**Do NOT waste peremptory challenges on:**
- Jurors you can get struck for cause
- Jurors who are unlikely to be seated anyway (high seat numbers)

## QUESTIONNAIRE RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR (from January panel — use as template for March panel)

These patterns from the January 22 questionnaire are the types to watch for on the new panel:

| Red Flag | Why | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "No" on instruction-following questions (Q26-33) | Can't follow law | Challenge for cause |
| Close friends with law enforcement (Q24) | Credibility bias toward police | Explore; likely peremptory |
| "Favor the Prosecutor" (Q34) | Admitted bias | Challenge for cause |
| Prior DUI jury service with guilty verdict | Pattern thinking | Explore carefully |
| Healthcare worker at hospital | May defer to "official" medical/test results | Explore |
| 12-step program connection | Strong feelings about alcohol | Explore; could help or hurt |
| "Don't watch news" | May be disengaged or may be independent thinker | Explore |
| PhD in pharmacology or similar science | Could understand your arguments OR could be a State expert | Explore carefully |

## NOTES

- The January 22 jury panel (75 jurors) was released when the trial was continued. A new panel will be summoned for March 31.
- The questionnaire FORMAT from Judge Hruby-Mills will likely be the same. Request access to the new questionnaire responses as early as possible before March 31.
- Ask the court clerk when questionnaire responses will be available — ideally you want them at least a few days before voir dire to pre-analyze.
