# STATE v. GOLUB (Case No. 235900706) - CASE SUMMARY

## CHARGES
1. **DUI - 2nd Offense in 10 Years** (Class A Misdemeanor)
2. **Failure to Signal** (Infraction)

**Note:** Prior conviction was for reckless driving, NOT DUI, but State seeks enhancement.

## KEY FACTS
- **Arrest Date:** September 6, 2023
- **Arresting Officer:** Corporal Brock Ernstsen (Utah Highway Patrol)
- **Breath Test Result:** 0.104 g/210L (single sample after 144-second test)
- **Defendant:** Peter Golub (Pro Se)
- **Judge:** Elizabeth A. Hruby-Mills, Third District Court
- **Prosecutor:** Joseph Johnson (5th prosecutor assigned to case)

### Critical Evidence Points:
1. **144-Second Breath Test:** Video shows physiologically impossible 144-second continuous blow (7-9x normal maximum of 12-20 seconds). Officer admitted test was "improperly done."
2. **24x Arrest Rate:** GRAMA data shows Corporal Ernstsen's DUI arrest rate is 24 times the state average, indicating potential confirmation bias.
3. **80+ Minutes Without Miranda:** Custody began at minute 5 (ordered out of vehicle), Miranda given at minute 85 (at jail).
4. **Officer 2:** Second officer present for 3.5+ hours but omitted from all reports.
5. **One-Leg Stand:** 0/4 clues of impairment (perfect performance).
6. **Traffic Stop:** Officer positioned 100-125 feet away with obstructed view; followed for 10 blocks with no additional violations.
